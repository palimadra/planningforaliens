title: "the long-form pitch: passive talent"
blurb: "People that aren't actively looking for a job are more likely to make great employees."

<p>
I am teaching myself the art of the long-form sales letter or what I'm calling the long-form pitch. In two attempts I have completely failed to connect with my audience. My first problem was assuming everyone was exactly like me and my second problem was a failure to accurately identify my audience. I had started to identify who I'm writing for in <a href="/blog/2013/02/04/second-pitch/">part two</a> and I am expanding on those thoughts here.
</p>

<p>
After my second attempt I began to group my audience into four different buckets based on happiness on the job and whether they were actively seeking a new job. After that exercise I knew I had to pick one of the groups to write for and that it made little sense to try and talk to all for groups. But I wasn't completely sure which group of people would be best to target. After doing some research, it turns out the recruiting industry already has lingo for the groups I had created. There is also a clear winner, in terms of which group I should be focused on, and some numbers to back it up.

<h2>Passive talent</h2>
<p>
Recruiters call people who are not actively seeking a job "passive talent." From the limited reading I've done I think that traditionally recruiters stay away from passive talent, but services like LinkedIn's Talent Finder have made it easier to reach out to these folks. And, according to a <href="http://www.slideshare.net/LinkedIn_EMEA_Events/partner-talent-solutions-corporate">an admittedly biased source</a>, passive talent is:
</p>
<ul>
<li>120% more likely to want to make an impact</li>
<li>56% more likely to want a corporate culture that fits their personality</li>
<li>33% more likely to want challenging work</li>
<li>17% more likely to need skill development skill opportunities</li>
<li>21% more likely to need recognition for their contributions</li>
</ul>
