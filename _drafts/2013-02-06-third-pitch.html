blurb: "People that aren't actively looking for a job are more likely to make great employees."

I am teaching myself the art of the long-form sales letter or what I'm calling the long-form pitch. In two attempts I have completely failed to connect with my audience. This is what happened after my third attempt.

<h3>Can a robot find you better jobs than a recruiter?</h3>

<p>Yes of course it can. But is it because we live in the future and machine learning algorithms are so advanced? Nope. It's because <span class="italics">recruiters suck so bad</span> that even a rudimentary bayesian classifier could probably do a better job.</p>

<p>I for one welcome our recruiting robot overlords.</p>

<h3>RecruiterBot hates recruiter spam (and resents being called rudimentary).</h3>
<p>
RecuiterBot's creators are amazing programmers. Just like you they love programming. RecruiterBot's biosensors register a slight uptick in heart beats per minute when they open Emacs to start hacking on a new project. They are not worried about finding a job because their skills are in demand.
</p>
<p>
Why do recruiters send such shitty job opportunities to such amazing humans? Most of the time the stuff is about one level above pure spam. Why? It's because <span class="italics">they are not programmers and they don't know what you are looking for</span>.
</p>

<h3>RecruiterBot is a job-seeking daemon process that emails you when it finds something good.</h3>
<p>
Tell RecruiterBot what's bothering you. While you're at it, tell RecruiterBot what you want your next job to look like and a few of your favorite programming languages and platforms. RecruiterBot is a great listener.

<ul style="list-style-type: none">
<li>Are you happy with your job but would jump on an opportunity to work with an education startup?</li>
<li>Are you ready to move up the ladder and lead your own team? </li>
<li>Do you want to work with developers that are way better than you and super-charge your learning curve? 
<li>Would you love to work for a space rocket company and fling a few things into orbit? (RecruiterBot gets it -- space is awesome)</li>
</ul>

<h3>We can't put an end to all recruiter spam...</h3>
<p>but we can promise this:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: none">
  <li>1. Any email you get from RecruiterBot will contain an awesome job that should at least worth consideration.</li>
  <li>2. Every email will be  written with the care and attention to detail that could only come from a robot.</li>
</ul>
