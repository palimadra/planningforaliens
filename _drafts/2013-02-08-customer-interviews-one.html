Here is how to start a company:
</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: none">
<li>1. Have a really cool idea that you are really excited about.</li>
<li>2. Think of all the ways this really cool idea will blow away your customers and change everything they do.</li>
<li>3. Dream of the all the ways this idea will make you rich and famous. </li>
<li>4. Consider applying to incubators. This may lead to VC money and meeting famous people. </li>
<li>5. Start working on a prototype</li>
<li>6. Run out of steam. (Prototyping is hard, let's play video games!)</li>
<li>7. Have a really cool idea that is much better than the one you are working on.</li>
<li>8. 'Pivot' to the new idea and mothball that code you just spent a few months of spare time on. Maybe slap a BSD license on there so it might be used by someone else and you can use it to pad your resume.</li>
<li>9. Goto step 2.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Okay, so that's not how you do it. Here's how you actually start a company:
</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: none">
  <li>
  <p>1. Think about the kinds and types of people who are your friends.</p>
  <p>These people are going to be your customers. Pick people you like.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>2. Think about the things that you are really interested in.</p>
  <p>You are going to be spending all of your time working on this. It should at least touch on some of your personal interests.</p>
  </li>
  <li>3. Look for an intersection of the two and identify markets (market == people that pay money for things that solve their problems).</li>
  <li>4. Identify problems in this market by listening to these people gripe about stuff that sucks.</li>
  <li>5. Pick a problem you can solve, that is interesting to you and involves the most personal skills and other assets you have available to you; take advantage of everything you can. Then put together a product idea that solves this problem. (No code. Not yet.)</li>
  <li>6. Talk to your market about their problem and offer your solution. Tweak your solution until they offer you money.</li>
  <li>7. ???? I've never been this far, at least not in this order. And I've definitely been past this point but with no customers, which is what tends to happen if you skip steps.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Everything here I have learned from trial and error. This is the stupidest way to learn something, but it seems I learn best when bashing my head against a wall repeatedly, and that's just how it is.
