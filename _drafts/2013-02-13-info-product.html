title: "Maybe an info product?"

<p>
For the past three weeks I've been exploring small business ideas. I've decided it's time I took a serious look at making an info product.
</p>

<h2>
What's an info product?
</h2>

<p>
A book. A series of video lectures. A well-designed pdf. An info product is something people buy to learn new things. If done right an info product can create a tidy profit in a short amount of time. Comapre this to subscription based revenue which is more stable but takes a long time to grow.
</p>
<p>
If I'm going to make a long-term career move towards making and selling software products I think it makes sense to make long-term plans. An info product seems like a great place to start learning. A small success here would give me the confidence and cash to try a small software as a service product.

<h2>
Web Apps From the Beginning.
</h2>

<p>
Thousands of people are learning to program or have already learned to program. But what they know is just a small slice of a much bigger pie. My experience at work tells me that it's very important for new developers to have a solid grasp of the full stack they are working with or your code is going to become unwieldy very quickly.
<p>
Imagine you are a mason and know only how to work with one kind of brick and one kind of mortar and can only build plain, flat walls. What happens when you need an arch over your window? What kind of brick makes sense for your facade? Should the foundation be made out of brick? Why are you even using brick in the first place?
</p>
<p>
Many new developers find themselves in this situation. They learn rudimentary Ruby on Rails skills so they can quickly throw up a basic page, but reality quickly grows too complicated for what Rails offers out of the box. You need to know Ruby, you need to know about HTTP and Javascript and HTML and CSS, etc. It's impossible to make good decisions without at least a rudimentary understanding of all the pieces that go into making a good web application.
</p>
<p>
What I plan to offer is a complete walkthrough of a typical web application from HTTP request to response. I will also an option to build and launch your own web application. Developers will write an HTTP server, templating language, URL router and a rudimentary ORM. They will also learn how to deploy their app and how to put their code on Github. They will end up with something they can point at and say, "I built that completely from the ground up and I understand everything that went into it."
</p>

<h2>
So I need to test this idea.
</h2>
<p>
Step one is to build a landing page and to start building an email list. I plan to follow the steps brendan dunn and nathan barry.
