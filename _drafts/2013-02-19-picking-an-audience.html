The first step was doing the research to really understand this pain point and to pick my audience. Should I focus on web designers that want to bring life to their designs? What about new entrepreneurs that don't have a technical cofounder and want to have a really firm grasp of the technology they are building their company on? Or what about people looking to make a career change?

Picking an audience (a term I've coined from Jason Fried and Amy Hoy), is really crucial. You need to pick people that hang out where you can easily find them. They should also have real problems that they will pay real money to solve. You should also be a part of your audience so you know how to speak their language out of the gate. Starting a business is hard enough. You should use every advantage you have available to you. Picking a strange and unfamiliar group of people means you will have to spend a ton of time learning about what they do and how they talk and the problems they have. You can shortcut this process by picking people you already know.

You will also be starting a blog for your audience, right? So if I picked PR professionals I'd be writing a ton of blog posts on PR -- not a topic I'm particularly passionate about. This is a lesson I've learned the hard way: building an audience is just like exercise, you have to figure out a way to make it fun or you'll never stick with it.

I read a zillion blog articles and forum posts with people wondering how to get started building a web application. There are a ton of other companies working on solving the same problem because a metric ton of people want to learn how to develop software.
