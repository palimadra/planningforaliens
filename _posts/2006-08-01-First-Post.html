<p>I havenâ€™t blogged in over a year. I started <a href="http://www.sean.fioritto.us/weblog">Meshsandbox </a>so that I could record my thoughts as I learned all about mesh networking. I quickly expanded the topic of the blog to include entrepreneurship, since I was learning about mesh networking in order to start a business. Considering the very narrow topic I had a relatively large audience. In short time I felt obligated to update Meshsandbox on a semi-regular basis with useful and interesting content. Once my energy shifted away from mesh networking, posting to Meshsandbox was like pulling teeth.</p><p>Planning for Aliens will be a reflection of what I am thinking about at the moment. It will catalogue the progression of my thoughts and ideas. I doubt this blog will never generate the kind of traffic Meshsandbox did because it will not be focused like a laser on one topic and it will not be full of useful information. Nevertheless, I am really happy to be blogging again.</p>
