<p>I can’t write. Seriously. I’m not happy with where my writing skills are at the moment. I came to this conclusion some time in December and so I committed to blogging at least once per week to improve the situation. Tonight I started writing a post about my motivations as an entrepreneur, and then I stopped writing it because it was crap. I don’t mind writing crap, I have to start somewhere, the problem is I don’t know why it’s crap. Yarg.</p><p>I need a new strategy. First, I think some books on writing are in order. I’m also going to pick a writing format, you know, like I’m only going to write sonnets. I probably won’t write sonnets, but I think giving myself some constraints is bound to help. I’m also canceling cable. Watching TV is not conducive to writing, or anything else other than watching TV for that matter.</p><p>Also, once per week is too ambitious. I’m going to knock it down a notch to twice per month and I’ll ratchet it up when my writing gets better. </p>
