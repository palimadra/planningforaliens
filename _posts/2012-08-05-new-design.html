blurb: With my new design I can put a little blurb of text here which is like a summary of my post. This is not a summary of this post, just mainly testing out the new feature.

A few months ago I used Jekyll to create a static site for my <a href="http://www.nymbus.org">newest project</a> and hosted it on S3. It worked out so well I decided to redesign this blog and stick it in a bucket too. And so here we are. Bring it on web scale traffic -- this blog can handle it. All six of my subscribers can hit this URL at THE SAME TIME and nothing will blow up. It's an incredible feat of engineering.

Almost 10 years ago I opened a textdrive account and launched my first Wordpress blog. Over the years I've used that old shared server account to host this blog and the sites and blogs of many of my friends. The account is so old I like to imagine the server is sitting in someone's closet underneath a pile of dirty clothes. Whenever I log in I'm reminded of the scene in Swordfish where Hugh Jackman retrieves his worm off of the PDP-11. The tape drives spins up and delivers my blog post over some 80's style visualization of cyberspace. And then I find John Travolta's dead body in my basement.

Unbelievably, I'm going to have to physically pick up a phone to cancel my account because I don't have an account with the new company that owns it. But they still manage to bill me, of course.

Looking back at my older posts it looks like I'm in the habit of prognosticating an increase in posting, and then having no follow-through whatsoever. So I think I'll continue the tradition. I'm going to write new, extremely thought-provoking material, every day, starting tomorrow. Yup.
