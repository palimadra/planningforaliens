The big three-OH is just around the corner so I've been doing some reflecting. Here's a thought: I've been a professional corporate drone for six years. Holy shit. That was not the plan.
</p>
<p>
I'm a decade removed from the halcyon days of neglecting my grades and paying my rent with poker winnings; Ten years ago I was playing too much DnD and starting idealistic startups that went nowhere. I have no idea how I managed to graduate. It's been six years since I haphazardly and cluelessly landed a job at Accenture; four years since I realized the consultant life was killing me, quit smoking, lost thirty pounds and moved to Chicago. And now I've spent four years living out a Dilbert comic strip at my nine-to-five.

I've had enough shitty jobs to know I'm living the good life; I'm pretty far removed from kicking away rats to slosh old frying fat into a grease dumpster. So this isn't really me complaining. But my career to date has either been unplanned or not going according to plan and I'm worried I might end up with regrets. The plan has always been to start my own thing: A small business. A crazy VC funded startup. Or whatever. I've wandered pretty far from the path but I hear some pretty music in the distance. I think I might head that-away and see what happens.
