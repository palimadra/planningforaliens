title: "tripping on stairs, every day"
blurb: "Buggy code is a very busy staircase with a bad stair (or two). In a poorly written or designed code base I spend a lot of time tripping on stairs; the role of Enterprise developer can basically be defined as \"seek out and trip on broken stairs.\""

Some time ago I came across this video of people tripping on a stair. One stair is slightly higher than the rest and as a result thousands of people nearly injure themselves daily.

It's a pretty clear example of the cost of bad design, especially in the most used parts of whatever it is you are making. I'm not sure what the cutoff would be, but given the amount of use this particular staircase gets it seems obviously worth the cost of pouring new stairs. What's interesting about this is it's a very small mistake, (one stair is off by an inch), but because the staircase is used so often it makes sense to spend quite a bit to fix it.

Developer tools are like busy staircases. I live in Python, Javascript, Emacs, Git and OS X. When something is wrong with one of these tools it wastes a lot of my time. I've wasted hours installing Postgres on OS X every time I get a new machine. Every time I create a new virtualenv with pip and install iPython I have to uninstall it and install readline first because I forgot that tab completion is screwy until I do this. Virtualenv itself is a tool that lets me route around quite a few broken staircases. Buggy code is a very busy staircase with a bad stair (or two). In a poorly written or designed code base I spend a lot of time tripping on stairs; the role of Enterprise developer can basically be defined as "seek out and trip on broken stairs."

Watching hundreds of people trip on a staircase is easy to visualize and I think it's easy to empathize as you watch each person nearly plant their face into concrete. So the next time your developers are complaining about the shitty tools you picked out for them, watch the staircase video and let them use something else. The next time your developers are complaining about not having enough time to fix bugs and cleanup their code and you don't give them more time I will personally fly you to this staircase in New York and make you trip on this stair over and over again until you get the point.
