Some time ago I came across this video of people tripping on a stair. One stair is slightly higher than the rest and as a result thousands of people nearly injure themselves daily.

It's a pretty clear example of the cost of bad design, especially in the most used parts of whatever it is you are making. I'm not sure what the cutoff would be, but given the amount of use this particular staircase gets it seems obviously worth the cost of pouring new stairs. What's interesting about this is it's a very small mistake, (one stair is off by an inch), but because the staircase is used so often it makes sense to spend quite a bit to fix it. Let's call this common sense notion that we should spend resources fixing broken design of our most oft-used things the Busy Staircase Hypothesis, or BSH from now on.

Programmers tend to spend more time in buggy code, so we can say that buggy code is like a busy staircase with a bad stair (or two). According to BSH I should spend time redesigning buggy code. Which of course means I'll start spending less time in this code because well designed code is by its nature less buggy. So obviously we should always write well-designed code that has less bugs so we spend less time tripping on stairs.

Except of course nothing is ever that simple with software.
