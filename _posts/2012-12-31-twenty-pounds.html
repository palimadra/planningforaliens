A little more than 5 years ago I weighed 219 pounds, thirty pounds more than I do today.
</p>
<p>
In high school I weighed 165 pounds and I was very lean and muscular. Sprinting for the track team plus an 18 year-old metabolism was a pretty good combination for keeping the weight off. I didn't even think about my weight. If anything I wanted to weigh more. This was the healthiest I've ever been.
</p>
<p>
After high school my family moved to Chicago. We have video of the trip that we watched recently. I had a hard time recognizing the person in the video as myself. Yes, I weigh a little more now, but the most striking difference was not physical: I was confident and sure of myself, and happy and content: I was _healthy_.
</p>
<p>
I got off to a rocky start in college, both academically and physically. Foolishly I thought my high school sprinter body was automatic so I ate whatever I wanted and didn't exercise at all. I lived on macaroni and cheese, oreos and microwavable mashed potatoes and I was depressed, barely passing classes and packing on the pounds. I can't attribute all of my college failures to my bad eating and exercise habits, but it didn't help. Three years into college I went on my first diet, but after quickly losing some weight I put it back on just as quickly. And so the pattern was established.
</p>
<p>
After college I got a job as a consultant. I put my personal life on hold and pushed aggressively down the good ol' career path. About a year into my new career I got sick and didn't get better as quickly as I should have, so I went to the doctor. I remember filling out the forms and being embarrassed; I was putting way too many check marks in the affirmative column. Do you smoke? Yes. Do you drink? Yes. How much? Yikes. When they weighed me I was a little over 200 pounds. The doctor told me I needed to get my weight below 200. According to him men gained weight even more quickly once they tipped over 200 and found it even harder to get back to a healthy weight. So of course I blocked this from my mind and put in more hours at work. After another year of working 80 hour weeks, smoking a pack a day and drinking way more beer than I should have I weighed 219 pounds.
</p>
<p>
The last four years have been, to some extent, about recovering from my consulting career. I started jogging in 2008 or 2009, I'm not really sure the exact date. I couldn't jog at even the slowest pace for more than 30 seconds, so I would jog for 30 seconds and then stop and walk for a few minutes until I could breathe again, puff on my inhaler, then start again. When I started jogging, I was still smoking, but after a few months I managed to finally quit smoking and I quit my stressful job at the same time. Later in 2009 I read <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/">The Hacker's Diet</a> and I started counting calories. I lost about 40 pounds and settled around 180. I recorded my weight daily and at some point I logged it online so you can see my progress in this graph:

<p>
After losing the weight I stopped counting calories and gradually drifted back up to 190. Frustrated with this weight gain and looking to avoid the drudgery of counting calories I looked for alternate ways to lose weight. My brother raced bikes in college. I went to one of his races and got caught up in the excitement and energy and pure athleticism. It reminded me of a track meet in high school. I bought a road bike and very quickly ramped up the hours until I was spending 15 hours a week on the bike. I also started paying more attention to nutrition and eating a low carb 'paleo' diet, (I wasn't very strict about it). I weighed 170 pounds and when I looked in the mirror what I saw finally matched what I thought I should see.
</p>
<p>
But 15 hours a week is not sustainable. I was frequently off the bike due to various overuse injuries so my fitness was never as good as it could have been. I had finally strung together a few months of consistent workouts when I crashed and was off my bike for 2 months because of a concussion. In those two months I put on 10 pounds. And when I could finally get back on the bike, I had lost some of my intensity and drive. I couldn't push myself to do 15 hours a week again, and I gradually let myself regress to my old eating habits. And my weight slowly drifted back up to...190. It seems my body really likes to weigh 190 pounds. You can even see in my weight chart that I plateaued for over a month at 190 pounds. Well, dammit, I don't want to weigh 190 pounds!
</p>
<p>
These days I would be considered healthy by most standards. My blood tests are 'EXCELLENT!!' according to my doctor. Between riding to work and more structured workouts I log about a thousand miles per year on my bike. I lift weights three times a week. I can run a 5k, (something I only dreamed about when I first started running years ago). I'm slow, but I get it done. I do yoga twice a week -- I can do a headstand. My weight hovers around 190 and I find that it is pretty easy to keep it there. For my height I'm "overweight", but not obese. My body fat percentage is somewhere between 20% and 25%. But is this really the best I can do? Why does my body insist that I weigh 190 pounds?
</p>
<p>
I know that I can weigh less by doing ridiculous amounts of cardiovascular exercise or through herculean efforts of willpower. But counting every calorie I put in my mouth and riding my bike 15 hours a week are not practical strategies for the long term. I need to put my limited will power to work elsewhere and as much as I love riding my bike, I love spending time with my wife and friends and family even more, and those kinds of hours in the saddle leave me little time for anything else outside of work and bikes. So is it a surprise that at some point last year I put up my hands and thought, "well, I guess that's it then. This is me. No point battling genetics. I'm lucky compared to some people."
</p>
<p>
But there is no way I'm accepting this. I _will_ figure out how to fix this problem.
