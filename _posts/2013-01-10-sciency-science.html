<h2>tl;dr</h2>
<p>
Why do we get fat? The modern environment is filled with highly palatable food options that override our evolved, subconscious ability to maintain a stable, healthy amount of fat. Modern foods cause inflamation and higher triglicerydes which cause leptin resistance. Leptin is the key hormone in appetite regulation. Ancestral diets, such as "Paleo" or "Primal Blueprint" are very good heuristics for choosing healthy foods that result in weight loss because the food you eat is simple and reduces leptin resistance.
</p>

<h2>
Being overweight is not a character flaw.
</h2>

<p>
I love donuts and pizza and beer and scotch and sushi and enchiladas and m&ms and brownies and fudge...and a few other things. I have been known to overindulge from time to time. But I'm also pretty rigorous in controlling what I eat and getting in regular workouts. I weigh myself every day and plot it on a graph. I lift weights. I do yoga twice a week and I ride my bike about 1500 miles per year. I spend a lot of time reading about diet and nutrition and thinking about what I'm eating and how much. I'm a human calorie counting machine. How many calories in a slice of wheat bread? 120. Apple? 50. Standard egg? 60. Clif Bar? 240. Craft beer? 170. I'm about 20 pounds overweight.
</p>

<p>
My beautiful, amazing wife eats whatever she wants and doesn't exercise at all. She spends _zero_ time thinking about nutrition or her body composition. She does not graph her weight or ponder if she's getting enough fiber every time she has a bowell movement (yes, I do that). I doubt she knows how many calories are in the sandwich she just ate for lunch. She's as skinny as a rail. So what's up with that? It's bullshit, that's what's up. I love her more than anything but I find this particular trait of hers infuriating. Everyone knows someone like my wife, and everyone knows someone like me. What's going on here?
</p>

<p>
Before we dive into the science behind this seeming paradox, I need you to admit something to yourself: When you're overweight relative reaches for an extra helping of pumpkin pie at Thanksgiving dinner you think to yourself, "Well, _there's_ your problem." When you are crammed next to an obese person on an airplane, I know you question that person's lifestyle choices. Somewhere in the back of all of our minds there's a little dude. He's wearing a fitted suit with polished shoes. His fingernails are manicured and he gets his hair trimmed every week. He's confident, but not cocky. His teeth are perfect. He loves watching cops, just to watch the stupid people fail at life. He's fond of saying stuff like, "Nobody knows how to drive! Except for me." or "All these fat people just need to eat less. Have some self-control!" I'm not a fan of this little dude, but he's running amok in my brain too. So, little dude, consider this a warning -- I'm about to punch you directly in the face with my moderately overweight fist.
</p>

<h2>A new mental model of weight loss.</h2>
<p>
About 5 years ago during a quest to lose a bunch of weight I ran into <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/">The Hacker's Diet</a> by John Walker. The plan appealed to the engineer in me. Here's the gist: You have a device inside you that regulates what you eat like a thermostat in a house regulates temperature, but some people's thermometers are slightly broken, so they think they need more calories than they actually do. His solution is to override that internal device with your own external system. It's simple thermodynamics, (calories in, calories out), and it uses statistics. Neato. I proceeded to turn myself into a calorie counting robot and lost 40 pounds. During this phase of my struggle with weight loss I enjoyed pretending like I was the Terminator. I would visualize calorie numbers floating over food in the cafeteria like I had my own awesome 80's style HUD. Predictably I burned out on analyzing every damn thing I ate, (and saying, "Hasta La Vista, Baby!" after eating it), after about a year. I decided to start exercising more and relax the calorie counting. I gained 10 pounds. It was about this time that I started wondering: wouldn't it be better to fix my "internal thermometer" instead of using up the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_depletion">precious resource of willpower</a> to replace it?
</p>

<h2>Self-control is only going to get us so far. You can't fight the adipostat.</h2>

<p>
Take a deep breath and hold it. Go on. Okay, so how long can you hold your breath? A few seconds? A minute? Until you die? Most of the time we don't think about breathing, we just do it. We have the ability to override breathing at will, but only to a certain extent, and some people are better at it than others.
</p>
<p>
In your brain is an algorithm that is constantly calculating blood oxygen levels. If your levels dip below or above where they should be, you automatically start breathing more or less. When this algorithm doesn't work it's called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxemia#Reduced_ventilatory_drive">hypoxia</a>.
</p>
<p>
Most current obesity research points to a similar algorithm in our brains that maintains our body fat. And just like breathing we can override this algorithm with feats of willpower and self-control, (because we're humans and we're awesome and can do shit like that). But how many overweight animals do you see on those nature programs you watch while eating a bag of potato chips? None? That's because their homeostatic system for maintaining their fat, called the ponderostat, (or the adipostat by some), is working perfectly. As it turns out, your average male lion is not a master of counting calories. They eat as many wildabeast as their pride can kill for them, (lazy bums), and it's never more than they need. 
</p>

<h2>How does the ponderostat/adipostat work?</h2>

<p>
At this point you probably have a pretty good sense of the obesity hypothesis I support, but let me summarize: How much we weigh is controlled by a subconscious algorithm, (I'm going to call it the adipostat from here forward), that works to keep our weight constant in much the same way our body works to keep our lungs respirating. We can override this system with self-control but we have a finite amount of willpower. Therefore self-control is insufficient for maintaining weight loss for most people. So we should fix our adipostat and let our body naturally shed the pounds.
</p>

<p>
Now to the task of explaining how this system works and how we fix it. And this is where I will lean heavily on the writing of Dr. Stephan Guyenet. When I began my research into maintainable weight loss I started out by reading <a href="http://garytaubes.com/">Gary Taubes'</a> tome <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Good-Calories-Bad-Controversial-Science/dp/1400033462">Good Calories. Bad Calories.</a> which supports a different hypothesis for obesity than what I'm writing about here, (he thinks your fat is what is malfunctioning, not your adipostat). After finishing the book I stumbled on a post by Stephan that put forth a <a href="http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.com/2011/08/carbohydrate-hypothesis-of-obesity.html">very strong case against</a> the hypothesis in Taubes' book. I proceeded to read his blog from beginning to end and as many of the research papers he linked to that I could download for free.
</p>

<p>
The rest of this post is essentially a summary of Stephan's blog, which in turn could be called a thoughtful summary of obesity literature. So it's a summary of a summary -- I'll probably gloss over a few key points.
</p>

<h2>Reader beware.</h2>

<p>
The adipostat hypothesis is well documented and supported by experimental results, however, it is not a mainstream idea, (as far as I can tell). But the adipostat is at the core of the rest of the story I have to tell, so we'll just be assuming it exists from here on out. What if it doesn't exist? Then most of this information is less useful than I think. Reader beware.
</p>

<h2>Leptin Resistance</h2>
<p>
What breaks our adipostat? Why don't we stay perfectly lean like lions or our hunter-gatherer ancestors? The first clue is something called leptin. Leptin is a hormone that circulates in our bloodstream. The fatter you are, the more of it you have. Your brain, specifically the hypothalamus, notices when you have more leptin than usual and tries to reduce it. How? By making you go on a diet or exercise more so you lose the extra leptin producing fat. You are a puppet and your hypothalamus is the master. Yes, even your hypothalamus Mr. Fatty McButterpants.
</p>

<p>
If the hypothalamus is so good at keeping my body fat regulated, why do I keep buying new pants every year? The answer is leptin resistance. For some reason your hypothalamus is not detecting all of the leptin. It thinks you have less fat than you do. If you gain some weight, the hypothalamus only sees some of the weight gain, and does a fantastic job of putting you on a diet and getting rid of it. But you're still left with the bits of fat it didn't see. Repeat ad nauseam and this vicious cycle is part of the story behind your love handles.
</p>

<p>
What causes leptin resistance? There are two prime suspects: inflammation and high levels of triglycerides in the blood stream.  
</p>

<p>
How do I fix inflammation? Ditch wheat, dairy, sugar, flour, processed foods and seed oils like vegetable and canola oil. Eat stuff high in Omega 3. Take a fish oil supplement. Increase the good bacteria in your gut by eating fermented stuff like saurkraut and kimchi. Maybe take a probiotic.
</p>

<p>
How do I reduce my triglycerides? Low-carb diets are very good at reducing triglycerides in the blood stream.
</p>

<p>
Now I realize I've just <kersplat> dumped some nutrition suggestions on you without much explanation. But this post is already getting lengthy and I only wanted to hit the broadstrokes. You can read more about these suggestions and the rationale behind them <a href="http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.com/2010/01/body-fat-setpoint-part-iv-changing.html">here</a>.
</p>

<h2>How to fatten up a rat.</h2>

<p>
In addition to leptin resistance there is another hypothesis: Modern food is just too tasty and too stimulating. It is engineered to produce the most pleasure per calorie. 
</p>

<p>
There is no fitness advantage in being morbidly obese, so we evolved to avoid this calamity. But in millions of years our DNA has never seen anything like the modern diet, and it's clearly not up to the task.
