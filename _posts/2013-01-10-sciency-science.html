<h2>tl;dr</h2>
<p>
Why do we get fat? The modern environment is filled with highly palatable food options that override our evolved, subconscious ability to maintain a stable, healthy amount of fat. Modern food also causes inflamation and higher triglicerydes which cause leptin resistance. Leptin is the key hormone in appetite regulation. Ancestral diets, such as "Paleo" or "Primal Blueprint" are very good heuristics for choosing healthy foods that result in weight loss because the food you eat is simple and reduces leptin resistance.

Being overweight is not a character flaw.

I love donuts and pizza and beer and scotch and sushi and enchiladas and m&ms and brownies and fudge...and a few other things. I have been known to overindulge from time to time. But I'm also pretty rigorous in controlling what I eat and getting in regular workouts. I weigh myself every day and plot it on a graph. I lift weights. I do yoga twice a week and I ride my bike about 1500 miles per year. I spend a lot of time reading about diet and nutrition and thinking about what I'm eating and how much. I'm a human calorie counting machine. How many calories in a slice of wheat bread? 120. Apple? 50. Standard egg? 60. Clif Bar? 240. Craft beer? 170. I'm about 20 pounds overweight.

My beautiful, amazing wife eats whatever she wants and doesn't exercise at all. She spends _zero_ time thinking about nutrition or her weight. She does not graph her weight or ponder if she's getting enough fiber every time she has a bowell movement (yes, I do that). I doubt she knows how many calories are in the sandwich she just ate for lunch. She's as skinny as a rail. So what's up with that? That is bullshit! I love her more than anything but I find this particular trait of hers infuriating. Everyone knows someone like my wife, and everyone knows someone like me. What's going on here?

Before we dive into the science behind this seeming paradox, I need you to admit something to yourself: When you're overweight relative reaches for an extra helping of pumpkin pie at Thanksgiving dinner you think to yourself, "Well, _there's_ your problem." When you are crammed next to an obese person on an airplane, I know you question that person's lifestyle choices. Somewhere in the back of all of our minds there's a little dude. He's wearing a fitted suit with polished shoes. His fingernails are manicured and he gets his hair trimmed every week. He's confident, but not cocky. His teeth are perfect. He loves watching cops, just to watch the stupid people fail at life. He's fond of saying stuff like, "Nobody knows how to drive! Except for me." or "All these fat people just need to eat less. Have some self-control!" I'm not a fan of this little dude, but he's running amok in my brain too. So, little dude, consider this a warning -- I'm about to punch you directly in the face with my moderately overweight fist.

<h2>A new mental model of weight loss.</h2>
<p>
About 5 years ago during a quest to lose a bunch of weight I ran into <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/">The Hacker's Diet</a> by John Walker. The plan appealed to the engineer in me. Here's the gist: You have a device inside you that regulates what you eat like a thermostat in a house regulates temperature, but some people's thermometers are slightly broken, so they think they need more calories than they actually do. The solution was to override that internal device with your own external system. It was simple thermodynamics, (calories in, calories out), and it used statistics. Neato. I proceeded to turn myself into a calorie counting robot and lost 40 pounds. Predictably I burned out on analyzing every damn thing I ate after about a year. I decided to start exercising more and relax the calorie counting. I gained 10 pounds. It was about this time that I started wondering: wouldn't it be better to fix my "internal thermometer" instead of using up the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_depletion">precious resource of willpower</a> to replace it?
</p>

<h2>Self-control is only going to get us so far. You can't fight the adipostat.</h2>

<p>
Take a deep breath and hold it. Go on. Okay, so how long can you hold your breath? A few seconds? A minute? Until you die? Most of the time we don't think about breathing, we just do it. We have the ability to override breathing at will, but only to a certain extent, and some people are better at it than others.
</p>
<p>
In your brain is an algorithm that is constantly calculating blood oxygen levels. If your levels dip below or above where they should be, you automatically start breathing more or less. When this algorithm doesn't work it's called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxemia#Reduced_ventilatory_drive">hypoxia</a>.
</p>
<p>
Most current obesity research points to a similar algorithm in our brains that maintains our body fat. And just like breathing we can override this algorithm with feats of willpower and self-control, (because we're humans and we're awesome and can do shit like that). But how many overweight animals do you see on those nature programs you watch while eating a bag of potato chips? None? That's because their homeostatic system for maintaining their fat, called the adipostat, is working perfectly. As it turns out, your average male lion is not a master of counting calories. They eat as many wildabeast as their pride can kill for them, (lazy bums), and it's never more than they need. 
</p>

<h2>How does the adipostat work?</h2>

<p>
At this point you probably have a pretty good sense of the obesity hypothesis I support, but let me summarize: How much we weigh is controlled by a subconscious algorithm, called the adipostat, that works to keep our weight constant in much the same way our body works to keep our lungs respirating. We can override this system with self-control but we have a finite amount of willpower. Therefore self-control is insufficient for maintaining weight loss for most people. So we should fix our adipostat and let our body naturally shed the pounds.
</p>

<p>
Now to the task of explaining how this system works and how we fix it. And this is where I will lean heavily on the writing of Dr. Stephan Guyenet. When I began my research into maintainable weight loss I started out by reading <a href="http://garytaubes.com/">Gary Taubes'</a> tome <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Good-Calories-Bad-Controversial-Science/dp/1400033462">Good Calories. Bad Calories.</a> which supports a different hypothesis for obesity than what I'm writing about here, (he thinks your fat is what is malfunctioning, not your adipostat). After finishing the book I stumbled on a post by Stephan that put forth a <a href="http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.com/2011/08/carbohydrate-hypothesis-of-obesity.html">very strong case against</a> the hypothesis in Taubes' book. I proceeded to read his blog from beginning to end and as many of the research papers he linked to that I could download for free.
</p>

<p>
Here are some of my favorite posts from his blog. I think this list does a pretty good job of summarizing Stephan's thoughts on modern obesity research.
