<h2>tl;dr</h2>

Why do we get fat? The modern environment is filled with highly palatable food options that override our evolved, subconscious ability to maintain a stable, healthy amount of fat. Modern food also causes inflamation and higher triglicerydes which cause leptin resistance. Leptin is the key hormone in appetite regulation. Ancestral diets, such as "Paleo" or "Primal Blueprint" are very good heuristics for choosing healthy foods that result in weight loss because the food you eat is simple and reduces leptin resistance.

Being overweight is not a character flaw.

I love donuts and pizza and beer and scotch and sushi and enchiladas and m&ms and brownies and fudge...and a few other things. I have been known to overindulge from time to time. But I'm also pretty rigorous in controlling what I eat and getting in regular workouts. I lift weights, I do yoga twice a week and I ride my bike about 1500 miles per year. I spend a lot of time reading about diet and nutrition and thinking about what I'm eating and how much. I weigh myself every day. I would say I'm doing the right thing with diet and exercise 80% of the time and the wrong thing 20% of the time. I'm about 20 pounds overweight.

My beautiful, amazing wife is just the opposite. She eats whatever she wants and doesn't exercise at all. She spends _zero_ time thinking about nutrition or her weight. She's as skinny as a rail. I love her more than anything but I find this particular trait of hers infuriating.

So what's up with that? That is bullshit. For my readers that don't have a weight problem, if you are like most folks I know that somewhere in the back of your mind there's a little dude yelling, "All these fat people just need to eat less. Have some self-control!" So if this is you and you have bothered to read this far I just want to warn you -- I'm about to punch that little dude directly in the face with my moderately overweight fist.

About 5 years ago during a quest to lose a bunch of weight I ran into <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/">The Hacker's Diet</a> by John Walker.
