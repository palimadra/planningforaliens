<h2>tl;dr</h2>
<p>
Why do we get fat? The modern environment is filled with highly palatable food options that override our evolved, subconscious ability to maintain a stable, healthy amount of fat. Modern foods cause inflammation and higher triglycerides which cause leptin resistance. Leptin is the key hormone in appetite regulation. Ancestral diets, such as "Paleo" or the "Primal Blueprint" are very good heuristics for choosing healthy foods that result in weight loss because the food you eat is simple and reduces leptin resistance. (Carbs? You should eat those.)
</p>

<h2>
Being overweight is not a character flaw.
</h2>
<p>
Somewhere in the back of your mind there's a little dude in a fitted suit. His fingernails are manicured and he gets his hair trimmed every week. His teeth are perfect, because he brushes them every day. His shoes are polished. He's confident, but not cocky.
</p>
<p>
He's a smug asshole.
</p>
<p>
He's the part of you that loves watching cops just to watch the stupid people fail at life. He's fond of saying stuff like, "Nobody knows how to drive. Except for me." or "All these fat people just need to eat less. Have some self-control."
</p>
<p>
I'm not a fan of this little dude, but he's running amok in my brain too. So, little dude, consider this a warning -- I'm about to punch you directly in the face with my moderately overweight fist.
</p>

<h2>Goddammit skinny people! **shakes fist at sky**</h2>

<p>
I love donuts and pizza and beer and scotch and sushi and enchiladas and m&ms and brownies and fudge...and a few other things. I have been known to overindulge from time to time. But in general, I'm rigorous about exercising and I carefully monitor what I eat.
</p>
<p>
I weigh myself every day and plot it on a graph. I lift weights. I do yoga twice a week and I ride my bike about 1500 miles per year. I spend a lot of time reading about diet and nutrition and thinking about what I'm eating. I'm a human calorie counting machine. How many calories in a slice of wheat bread? 120. Apple? 50. Standard egg? 60. Clif Bar? 240. Craft beer? 170.
</p>
<p>
I'm about 20 pounds overweight.
</p>
<p>
My beautiful, amazing wife eats whatever she wants and doesn't exercise at all. She spends _zero_ time thinking about nutrition. She does not graph her weight or ponder if she's getting enough fiber every time she has a bowel movement (yes, I do that). To her, calories are an abstract concept.
</p>
<p>
She is not even a little overweight. My nickname for her is "skinnywinny".
</p>
<p>
It's not fair. I love her more than anything but I find this particular trait of hers infuriating. For all the time and effort I put into health and fitness, I get love handles. It's such bullshit.
</p>
<p>
Everyone knows someone like my wife, and everyone knows someone like me. What's going on here?
</p>

<h2>A new mental model of weight loss.</h2>
<p>
About 5 years ago during a quest to lose a bunch of weight I ran into <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/">The Hacker's Diet</a> by John Walker. The plan appealed to the engineer in me. Here's the gist: You have a device inside you that regulates what you eat like a thermostat in a house regulates the temperature, but some people's thermometers are slightly broken, so they think they need more calories than they actually do. His solution is to override that internal device with an external system: ignore everything your body tells you and count calories.
</p>
<p>
After reading this I thought to myself, "It's simple thermodynamics, (calories in, calories out), and it uses statistics. Neato." I proceeded to turn myself into a calorie counting robot and lost 40 pounds.
</p>
<p>
I was the Terminator. I would visualize neon green calorie numbers floating over food in the grocery store like I had my own awesome glowing, 80's style HUD embedded in my cornea.
</p>

<h2>Even the Terminator eats too many Samoas.</h2>

<p>
Predictably I burned out on analyzing every damn thing I ate like a robot from the future, (and saying, "Hasta La Vista, Baby!" after eating it). I decided to start exercising more and relax the calorie counting. I gained 10 pounds.
</p>
<p>
I couldn't bring myself to start counting calories again. It was just too depressing and too exhausting. I wanted to put my energy into other things, and the harder I worked and the more I focused, the more food I ate. It's a familiar tale.
</p>
<p>
As my yoga instructor is fond of saying, let's go back to the breath. Take a deep breath and hold it. Go on. Okay, so how long can you hold your breath? A few seconds? A minute? Until you die? We have the ability to override breathing at will, but only to a certain extent, and some people are better at it than others. But most of the time we don't think about breathing, we just do it. 
</p>
<p>
Some obesity research points to a similar mechanism in our brains that maintains our body fat. It's called the ponderostat or sometimes the adipostat. We'll call it the adipostat from now on. We can override the adipostat, just like we can stop breathing, with feats of willpower and self-control. But <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_depletion">there are limits to our self-control</a>.
</p>
<p>
Wouldn't the best solution to weight loss be to simply fix the adipostat?
</p>

<h2>How does the adipostat work and how does it break?</h2>
<p>
Now to the task of explaining how this system works and how we fix it. And this is where I will lean heavily on the writing of Dr. Stephan Guyenet.
</p>
<p>
When I began my research into maintainable weight loss I started out by reading <a href="http://garytaubes.com/">Gary Taubes'</a> tome <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Good-Calories-Bad-Controversial-Science/dp/1400033462">Good Calories. Bad Calories.</a> which supports a different hypothesis for obesity than what I'm writing about here, (he thinks your fat is what is malfunctioning, not your adipostat). After finishing the book I stumbled on a post by Stephan that put forth a <a href="http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.com/2011/08/carbohydrate-hypothesis-of-obesity.html">very strong case against</a> the hypothesis in Taubes' book. I proceeded to read his blog from beginning to end and as many of the research papers he linked to that I could download for free.
</p>

<p>
The rest of this post is essentially a summary of Stephan's blog, which in turn could be called a thoughtful summary of obesity literature. So it's a summary of a summary -- I'll probably gloss over a few points. If you want to just read everything from the beginning, I've included links at the bottom of this post to get you started.
</p>

<h2>A quick aside regarding the adipostat.</h2>
<p>
The adipostat hypothesis is well documented and supported by experimental results, however, it is not a mainstream idea, (as far as I can tell). But the adipostat is at the core of the rest of the story I have to tell, so we'll just be assuming it exists from here on out. What if it doesn't exist? Then most of this information is less useful than I think.
</p>

<h2>Leptin resistance.</h2>
<p>
What breaks our adipostat? Why don't we stay perfectly lean like lions, gazelles and zebras -- or even our own hunter-gatherer ancestors? 
</p>
<p>
Leptin is a hormone that circulates in our bloodstream. The fatter you are, the more of it you have. Your brain, specifically the hypothalamus, notices when you have more leptin than usual and tries to reduce it. How? By making you go on a diet or exercise more so you lose the extra leptin producing fat. You are a puppet and your hypothalamus is the master.
</p>

<p>
If the hypothalamus is so good at keeping my body fat regulated, why do I keep buying new pants every year? The answer is leptin resistance. For some reason your hypothalamus is not detecting all of the leptin. It thinks you have less fat than you do. If you gain some weight, the hypothalamus only sees some of the weight gain, and does a fantastic job of putting you on a diet and getting rid of it. But you're still left with the bits of fat it didn't see. Repeat ad nauseam and this vicious cycle is part of the story behind your love handles.
</p>

<p>
What causes leptin resistance? There are two prime suspects: inflammation and high levels of triglycerides in the blood stream.  
</p>

<p>
How do you fix inflammation? Ditch wheat, dairy, sugar, flour, processed foods and seed oils like vegetable and canola oil. Eat stuff high in Omega 3. Take a fish oil supplement. Increase the good bacteria in your gut by eating fermented stuff like sauerkraut and kimchi. Maybe take a probiotic.
</p>

<p>
How do you lower your triglycerides? Low-carb diets are very good at reducing triglycerides in the blood stream.
</p>


<h2>How to fatten up a rat.</h2>

<p>
In addition to leptin resistance there is another hypothesis: Modern food is just too tasty and too stimulating for us to handle. 
</p>

<p>
In an obesity study done in 1976, researchers fed rats something they called the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1013192">Cafeteria Diet</a>. These rats rapidly gained weight and began to have what looks like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome">Metabolic Syndrome</a> (warning, shirtless, fat dude photos lurk on the other side of that link).
</p>

<p>
In <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5216999">another study</a>, but this time on humans, researchers asked subjects to eat a neutrally flavored liquid diet administered via a tube from a machine. This is not exactly gourmet cooking. They could eat as much as they wanted, but nothing else.
</p>
<p>
Lean subjects continued to eat as many calories as they normally would and maintained their weight. Obese subjects massively reduced their caloric intake and began to lose weight immediately. Even more interesting is the obese subjects said they weren't hungry at all even though they were eating extremely low calorie diets. That does not sound like any low calorie diet I've ever been on.
</p>

<p>
There is no fitness advantage in being morbidly obese and we evolved to avoid this calamity. But in millions of years our DNA has never seen anything like the modern diet, and it's clearly not up to the task. But the good news is it appears we can get things back to normal if we eat bland liquid from a tube.
</p>

<p>
Or we could just stop eating the Cafeteria Diet and instead eat simple meals made with fresh, whole foods, most of the time. 
</p>

<p>
Now I realize I've just <kersplat> dumped some nutrition suggestions on you without much explanation. But this post is already getting lengthy and I only wanted to hit the broad strokes. You can read more about these suggestions and the rationale behind them if you follow the links at the bottom of this post.
</p>

<h2>The primal hack.</h2>

<p>
If you want a quick hack for picking foods that repair leptin resistance and avoid the Cafeteria Food trap you could do worse than adapting a so-called paleo, primal or "ancestral diet." The idea is to look at the Snickers bar in your hand, ask yourself, "Would my prehistoric ancestors have had access to Snickers bars?" If the answer is no, put it down. If the answer is yes, eat as much as you want.
</p>

<p>
Of course it's pretty easy to get carried away with this line of thinking. Before you know it you're buying a buffalo carcass and letting it decompose a little in your backyard before you eat it, mostly raw. But if you don't go too crazy, the foods you end up eating will be right in line with the scientific evidence we've just looked at.
</p>
