Why do we get fat? The modern environment is filled with highly palatable food options that override our evolved, subconscious ability to maintain a stable, healthy amount of fat. Modern food also causes inflamation and higher triglicerydes which cause leptin resistance. Leptin is the key hormone in appetite regulation. Ancestral diets, such as "Paleo" or "Primal Blueprint" are very good heuristics for choosing healthy foods that result in weight loss because the food you eat is simple and reduces leptin resistance.

Being overweight is not a character flaw.

I love donuts and pizza and beer and scotch and sushi and enchiladas and m&ms and brownies and fudge...and a few other things. I have been known to overindulge from time to time. But I'm also pretty rigorous in controlling what I eat and getting in regular workouts. I weigh myself every day and plot it on a graph. I lift weights. I do yoga twice a week and I ride my bike about 1500 miles per year. I spend a lot of time reading about diet and nutrition and thinking about what I'm eating and how much. I'm a human calorie counting machine. How many calories in a slice of wheat bread? 120. Apple? 50. Standard egg? 60. Clif Bar? 240. Craft beer? 170. I'm about 20 pounds overweight.

My beautiful, amazing wife eats whatever she wants and doesn't exercise at all. She spends _zero_ time thinking about nutrition or her weight. She does not graph her weight or ponder if she's getting enough fiber every time she has a bowell movement (yes, I do that). I doubt she knows how many calories are in the sandwich she just ate for lunch. She's as skinny as a rail. So what's up with that? That is bullshit! I love her more than anything but I find this particular trait of hers infuriating. Everyone knows someone like my wife, and everyone knows someone like me. What's going on here?

Before we dive into the science behind this seeming paradox, I need you to admit something to yourself: When you're overweight relative reaches for an extra helping of pumpkin pie at Thanksgiving dinner you think to yourself, "Well, _there's_ your problem." When you are crammed next to an obese person on an airplane, I know you question that person's lifestyle choices. Somewhere in the back of all of our minds there's a little dude. He's wearing a fitted suit with polished shoes. His fingernails are manicured and he gets his hair trimmed every week. He's confident, but not cocky. His teeth are perfect. He loves watching cops, just to watch the stupid people fail at life. He's fond of saying stuff like, "Nobody knows how to drive! Except for me." or "All these fat people just need to eat less. Have some self-control!" I'm not a fan of this little dude, but he's running amok in my brain too. So, little dude, consider this a warning -- I'm about to punch you directly in the face with my moderately overweight fist.

<h2>A new mental model of weight loss.</h2>
<p>
About 5 years ago during a quest to lose a bunch of weight I ran into <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/">The Hacker's Diet</a> by John Walker. The plan appealed to the engineer in me. Here's the gist: You have a device inside you that regulates what you eat like a thermostat in a house regulates temperature, but some people's thermometers are slightly broken, so they think they need more calories than they actually do. The solution was to override that internal device with my own external system. It was simple thermodynamics, (calories in, calories out), and it used statistics. Neato. I proceeded to turn myself into a calorie counting robot and lost 40 pounds. Predictably I burned out on analyzing every damn thing I ate after about a year. I decided to start exercising more and relax the calorie counting. I gained 10 pounds. It was about this time that I started wondering: wouldn't it be better to fix my "internal thermometer" instead of using up the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_depletion">precious resource of willpower</a> to replace it?

<h2>Self-control is only going to get us so far. You can't fight the adipostat.</h2>

Take a deep breath and hold it. Go on. Okay, so how long can you hold your breath? A few seconds? A minute? Until you die? Most of the time we don't think about breathing, we just do it. We have the ability to override breathing at will, but only to a certain extent. Some people are better at it than others. In your brain is an algorithm that is constantly calculating blood oxygen levels. If your levels dip below or above where they should be, you automatically start breathing more or less. Most current obesity research points to a similar algorithm in our brains that maintains our body fat. And just like breathing we can override this algorithm with feats of willpower and self-control, because we're humans and we're awesome and can do shit like that. But how many overweight animals do you see on those nature programs you watch while eating a bag of potato chips? None? That's because their homeostatic system for maintaining their fat, called the adipostat, is working perfectly. Your average male lion is not a master of counting calories. They eat as many wildabeast as their pride can kill for them, and it's never more than they need.
