<p>
I have designed a diet for myself based on what I learned after devouring large quantities of cookies and weight-loss reading material during my vacation. The diet is designed to meet two criteria:
</p>

<p>1. Improve leptin sensitivity</p>
<p>2. Decrease reward feedback by eating simple, "less palatable" food.</p>

<h2>Breakfast, lunch and dinner.</h2>

<p>
Breakfast is eggs, scrambled with no seasoning, uncured bacon and a side of berries covered in cocunut milk. I also drink a few cups of decaf coffee with cocunut milk mixed in.
</p>

<p>
Lunch is a substantial salad with a vinagrette, a handful of raw almonds, a baked chicken thigh (bone-in with skin) and a banana. The salad is filled with mushrooms, bell peppers, a full avocado and leafy greens (I eat a variety of greens). I eat the salad first and then the other items if I'm hungry.
</p>

<p>
For dinner I eat a piece of salmon cooked in cocunut oil. I chop up summer squash, onions and mushrooms and sautee them in cocunut oil. No seasoning. I also eat a few forkfuls of sauerkraut.
</p>

<p>
After dinner I've been drinking a glass of red wine. I take supplements in the morning and before I go to bed: fish oil, d3, magnesium, probiotics, coq10. I drink as much water as I want.
</p>

<h2>The rules</h2>

<p>
I do not count calories. I eat as much as I want at each meal. I do not snack between meals. No snacking helps me differentiate between real hunger and simple cravings. I sometimes mistake the two.
</p>

<h2>It's pretty boring.</h2>
<p>
This diet meats both of my criteria. It is anti-inflammatory and has low palatability. That's not to say the food isn't tasty. I enjoy the flavors, but not too much. Also, palatability is more than just flavor. Smells and colors and flavor combinations are a part of what determines palatability. Variability is also important. If you eat the same thing over and over, it becomes less palatable. So I eat the same thing every day. 
</p>

<p>
This diet is also low on carbohydrates. This should lower my triglicerydes which in turn should increase my leptin sensitivity. Also, low carbohydrate diets make it easier to skip meals or abstain from snacking.
