<p>
I am teaching myself the art of the long-form sales letter or what I'm calling the long-form pitch. I've written dozens of 37Signals style landing pages with pretty pictures and bullet points of benefits. With this approach my conversion rates have been good enough, (when I have something worth buying). But I'm keen to learn new things and the long-form pitch seems to work really, really well when executed correctly.
</p>

<h2>What's a long-form pitch?</h2>
<p>
The general idea behind the long-form pitch seems to be:
</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
<li>1. Don't worry about the length of the content. Just write what needs to be said.
<li>2. Describe the pain.</li>
<li>3. Establish trust and credibiilty.</li>
<li>4. Offer the cure for the pain.</li>
</ul>
<p>
There should be an emphasis on talking about your customer and not about you. And of the examples I've encountered, the writing style is casual and full of personality. 
</p>
<p>
 I'm drawing my inspiration from a couple AppSumo emails and Amy Hoy's <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120505071731/http://charmhq.com/">pitch for Charmed</a> and her pitch for 30X500 titled <a href="http://unicornfree.com/2012/shut-up-and-take-my-money-or-how-to-pitch-so-people-will-listen">Shut Up and Take My Money!"</a>.
</p>

<h2>What am I pitching?</h2>
<p>
I have a new side project/business idea. I am helping great businesses hire great developers. Of course another way to look at the problem is to help great developers find great jobs, but I've decided to put businesses on the paying end of the equation. So while I'm doing crazy research to make sure I deeply understand the challenges of hiring developers I thought I would practice my pitching skills on the non-paying portion of my customer base. Conveniently I am a developer so I shouldn't have too much trouble writing for this particular audience. (Or so I thought).
</p>

<h2>My first attempt was a total failure</h2>
<p>
A few days ago I wrote up my first pitch. Before I wrote the pitch I made a few assumptions.
</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: none">
  <li>1. My audience is an employed developer not actively looking for a job.</li>
  <li>2. My goal was to convince this developer to sign up for a weekly email with really interesting/intriguing job opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  So this is describes me. I'm not actively seeking a job, but I'm pretty bored at work and I recognize I should be looking for other opportunities to grow my career. </p>
<p>
Based on that I ripped out what I thought was a fun to read description of life in a cubicle farm with a really compelling call to action at the end. I sent it off to two of my developer friends and asked for reactions. These were people I would consider to be strongly in my target audience.
</p>
<p>
They thought the writing was great and that all of those "enterprise devs" out there would probably be pretty interested. I wanted them to say, "Dude, you have my number. That described me exactly." Total fail.
<p>
My biggest mistake was I didn't do enough research into the mentality of my customer. I assumed I could use myself as a template and that I was the customer, and I was wrong. 
</p>
<p>
I'll write more on my second attempt in part two. It also failed, just not as badly.
</p>

<h2>Here is my first long-form pitch attempt.</h2>

<p> (In big letters on the front page). Badass programming jobs delivered to your inbox every Monday. (stand-in-name) is the cure for your shitty job./p>
 
 
<h3>You didn't think your job would be this bad</h3>
<p>
Weekends are tropical islands in a foaming, frothy sea of boring shit. Every Monday the alarm clock forces you into consciousness by punching you in the face. The office is some sort of hive mind, swarming with blue button-down shirts and khakis. This isn't what you wanted
</p>

<h3>You never expected to loathe programming.</h3>
<p>
But years of diving into twisty legacy code with no test coverage and dealing with a boss that doesn't know anything about code has left you a little...unstable. Programming used to be fun but now you find yourself doing the same thing over and over again. Dude, this seriously blows.
 </p>

<h3>I know how you feel.</h3>
<p>
I've been an enterprise developer for seven years. I've eaten through my fair share of spaghetti code. I've used source control that was written in the 80's. Moving code to production involved a three page form, two signatures and a meeting with ALL THE MANAGERS. You do what you have to do to survive. 
</p>
<h3>You're trapped in a rut.</h3>
<p>
"Okay", you say, "it's not great. But it's not that bad. The pay is good and we have a matching 401k." Friend, fellow code monkey, you are trapped in a rut. It's a very comfortable rut with air conditioning and padded beige walls, but you can do better. There are other jobs. There are companies that care about software fundamentally. They use the latest tools and programming languages. They have real, honest-to-god career paths for developers where you don't have to be a manager. Hell, your manager might even be a better programmer than you. Can you imagine if your boss actually appreciated the value of large chunks of uninterrupted time?
 </p>
<h3>Where are all of these awesome jobs?</h3>
<p>
But when you scan the job boards all you see is some douchebag MBA looking for ninjas and rockstars to work 80 hour weeks for a pittance and some equity of dubious value. Or some recruiter drone spouting a skills list of techno-babble for some shady "advertising" company. You know you should "grow your network", but networking sucks. You'd rather play Halo.
 </p>
<h3>Sign up for (stand-in-name), play Halo and still get leads on great jobs.</h3>
<p>
We find the best jobs and send them to you every Monday morning. Let's call it job porn, and it's totally safe for work (as long as your boss isn't hovering over your shoulder). Every job is vetted -- I promise to put them through the wringer. If it's not an amazing job, it never hits your inbox.
</p>
<p>
I know that every Monday morning you read blogs and Hacker News and generally do anything to avoid starting real work. (Don't deny it, I know what's up.) When you sign up for (stand-in-name) you're adding one more thing to do before you start work. But wait, there's more.
</p>
<p>
You can also apply for the job. It's like you went out to a networking event, found out about a job and then convinced someone to write you an introduction letter -- except all you did was show up for work and check your email. It's like a "networking event" API or something.
</p>
<h3>There will be a filter.</h3>
<p>
Before we send off your application there will be some kind of filter. A fizzbuzz test. Maybe a link to your portfolio or github profile. If you don't have code we can look at you may have to write a sample. I'm sure you get the reasoning behind this -- most employers can't even pick programmers that know how to write the simplest code. They play the lottery every time they hire. And every time they hire a schmuck they waste a ton of money. If we're going to convince the best companies to list their jobs here we need to at least assure them we know what we are doing.
 </p>
<p>
And don't worry if you're a newb, there will be jobs for every level of programmer. You don't have to be John Resig.
</p>
<p>
And that's it. We've just made Mondays awesome.
</p>

Sign up for <list> today and get your first list of fucking great jobs this Monday. (get me some button)
