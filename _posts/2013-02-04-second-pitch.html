After my <a href="/blog/2013/02/01/first-pitch/">first attempt</a> I learned that my copy did not resonate with any of the developers I sent it to. After digging into it a little further I learned that I was a bit too cynical. It turns out not everyone views their job as a "foaming, frothy sea of boring shit." 
</p>

<p>
So I rewrote the pitch to be more upbeat. It's more about upgrading your current position and less about leaving a shitty job behind you. 
</p>

<section>
<h2>It didn't work.</h2>

<p>
I sent this version of the letter to two different people. One is actively looking for a job while currently employed and the other is not actively looking and seems to enjoy his job. My friend who is actively looking for a job would have signed up for the service because, well, why not? Maybe he'll find something interesting there. He didn't really think the copy was meant for him, so I again failed in that respect.

<p>
My friend who is currently employed thought maybe the service was targeting "brogrammers" (which is funny, but also I'm a little embarrassed he thought this -- I'm not a brogrammer!), but certainly not him. When I asked him if he would have signed up he said no, and then this, "There are a handful of companies I check from time to time to see what openings they have because I feel like they'd be dream jobs (ie sports related, or up and coming marketing agencies.. usually directly on their website)." Basically he's happy enough where he is at and looking for another job is simply not on his radar, unless it's a "dream job" which for him would be to work for a professional sports team.
</p>

<p>
So for my next letter I need to figure out who I'm targeting. I think I can divide up programmers into four groups:
<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li>1. Happy at work and looking for a new job. (e.g. have to move for family reasons).</li>
<li>2. Happy at work and not looking for a new job. (e.g. Someone I am jealous of).</li>
<li>3. Not happy at work and looking for a new job.</li>
<li>4. Not happy at work and not looking for a new job.(e.g. Don't think they could get a better job. Too worried about taking a risk. etc.)</li>
</p>

<p>
Which of the quadrants represent the best opportunity? I'm not sure yet. But this does help me write my next pitch. Looking at my last pitch through this lense it's obvious my last pitch was scattered across these quadrants. The first paragraph talks about how your job is "buggy" which if you are in quadrant 2 makes no sense. The second paragraph accuses the reader of being in a "rut" and that their seemingly good job isn't really that good at all. Ok, so now I'm in quadrant 4, quadrant 2 is offended and quadrant 3 is thinking "I know asshole, that's why I'm looking for a new job."
</p>

<p>
So for my next act I'll have to pick one of the quadrants. Quadrant 1, (happy but looking for a new job), is just unlikely to happen so the number of people I can target is really small. So it's out.
</p>
<p>
Quadrant 2, (happy and not looking for a new job), is pretty interesting, but it may restrict me to certain kinds of employers. I can't get someone who is happy at their job to leave for anything other than a dream job. Is that the kind of business I want to run? Maybe.
</p>
<p>
Quadrant three, (not happy at work and looking for a new job), would seem to be the most common. But again, this quadrant would also dictate the kind of business I need to run. It means I need to provide a timely service; I can't collect their email and then send them a note a few months later when I've found the perfect gig, because they've probably moved on already. So I would need to send them job possibilities as fast as possible, which means that the jobs won't be a perfect match -- bad for them and bad for my paying customers, the employers.
<p>
And finally quadrant 4, where I would have to take on the role of coach and convince people that they can make positive changes in their lives. It's appealing, but seems hard and I'm not sure I have the personality for it.
</p>

<p>
I'm leaning towards quadrant 2 which would mean I'm finding dream jobs for people that are already satisfied with their current job. I think there is flexibility in what kinds of employers I can work with because not everyone has the same dream job. This should also help me with the rest of my customer interviews. (I've just completed my first and I may write something about it).
</p>
<p>
So, I'm off to write the third version of my pitch and send it off to a few folks. I've included the second version of my pitch below.

<h2>Long-form pitch, take two.</h2>

<h3>sudo apt-get upgrade  job</h3>
<br/>
<h3>Badass programming jobs delivered to your inbox every Monday.</h3>
<br/>

<h3>Your job has a few bugs and the latest patches are throwing compiler errors.</h3>
<p>
Maybe years of diving into twisty legacy code with no test coverage and dealing with a boss that doesn't know anything about code has left you a little...unstable. Or maybe it's time to stretch your programming skills but you just can't convince anyone to let you use Node.js/Rails/latest nosql thing/. Or perhaps your tired of writing yet another CRUD app and want to work on interesting problems.
</p>

<p>Whatever it is, you know your job could use an upgrade.</p>

<h3>You're trapped in a rut.</h3>
<p>
"Okay", you say, "my job could be better. But it's not that bad. The pay is good and we have a matching 401k." Friend, fellow code monkey, you are trapped in a rut. It's a very comfortable rut with air conditioning and padded beige walls, but you can do better. There are other jobs. There are companies that care about software fundamentally. They use the latest tools and programming languages. They have real, honest-to-god career paths for developers where you don't have to be a manager. Hell, your manager might even be a better programmer than you. Can you imagine if your boss actually appreciated the value of large chunks of uninterrupted time?
</p>
<h3>It' s a great time to be a nerd. Our skills are in demand. But where are the awesome jobs?</h3>
<p>
When you scan the job boards all you see is some douchebag MBA looking for ninjas and rockstars to work 80 hour weeks for a pittance and some equity of dubious value. Or some recruiter drone spouting a skills list of technobabble for some shady "advertising" company. You know you should "grow your network", but networking sucks. You'd rather play SC2.
</p>
<h3>I know how you feel.</h3>
<p>
I've been an enterprise developer for seven years. My programming skills are an elven sword forged in the fiery depths of spaghetti code,  committee reviews and death marches. I've used source control that was written in the 80's where moving code to production involved a three page form, two signatures and a meeting with ALL THE MANAGERS. I feel your pain because I've lived your pain. I know what a really great software job should look like.
</p>
<h3>Sign up for (stand-in-name), play SC2 and upgrade your job.</h3>
<p>
I find the best jobs and send them to you every Monday morning. Let's call it job porn, and it's totally safe for work (as long as your boss isn't hovering over your shoulder). Every job is vetted -- I promise to put them through the wringer. If it's not an amazing job, it never hits your inbox.
</p>
<p>
I know that every Monday morning you read blogs and Hacker News and generally do anything to avoid starting real work. (Don't deny it, I know what's up.) When you sign up for (stand-in-name) you're adding one more thing to do before you start work. But wait, there's more.
</p>
<p>
You can also apply for the job. It's like you went out to a networking event, found out about a job and then convinced someone to write you an introduction letter -- except all you did was show up for work and check your email. It's like a "networking event" API or something.
</p>
<h3>There will be a filter.</h3>
<p>
Before we send off your application there will be some kind of filter. A fizzbuzz test. Maybe a link to your portfolio or github profile. If you don't have code we can look at you may have to write a sample. I'm sure you get the reasoning behind this -- most employers can't even pick programmers that know how to write the simplest code. They play the lottery every time they hire. And every time they hire a schmuck they waste a ton of money. If we're going to convince the best companies to list their jobs here we need to at least assure them we know what we are doing.
</p>
<p>
And don't worry if you're a newb, there will be jobs for every level of programmer. You don't have to be John Resig.
