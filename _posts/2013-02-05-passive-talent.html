title: "the long-form pitch: passive talent"
blurb: "People that aren't actively looking for a job are more likely to make great employees."

<p>
I am teaching myself the art of the long-form sales letter or what I'm calling the long-form pitch. In two attempts I have completely failed to connect with my audience. My first problem was assuming everyone was exactly like me and my second problem was a failure to accurately identify my audience. I had started to identify who I'm writing for in <a href="/blog/2013/02/04/second-pitch/">part two</a> and I am expanding on those thoughts here.
</p>

<p>
After my second attempt I began to group my audience into four different buckets based on happiness on the job and whether they were actively seeking a new job. After that exercise I knew I had to pick one of the groups to write for and that it made little sense to try and talk to all four groups. But I wasn't completely sure which group of people would be best to target. After doing some research, it turns out the recruiting industry already has lingo for the groups I had created. There is also a clear winner, in terms of which group I should be focused on, and some numbers to back it up.
</p>

<h2>Passive talent</h2>
<p>
Recruiters call people who are not actively seeking a job "passive talent." From the limited reading I've done I think that traditionally recruiters stay away from passive talent, but services like LinkedIn's Talent Finder have made it easier to reach out to these folks. And, according to <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/LinkedIn_EMEA_Events/partner-talent-solutions-corporate">an admittedly biased source</a>, passive talent is:
</p>
<ul>
<li>120% more likely to want to make an impact</li>
<li>56% more likely to want a corporate culture that fits their personality</li>
<li>33% more likely to want challenging work</li>
<li>17% more likely to need skill development skill opportunities</li>
<li>21% more likely to need recognition for their contributions</li>
</ul>
<p>
From my perspective it means I can cross off two of the four groups I had yesterday, the groups that were actively seeking a job.
</p>
<p>
But wait, there's more. There are categories of passive talent. Some people are more passive than others. LinkedIn <a href="http://talent.linkedin.com/blog/index.php/2011/12/passive-candidates-accelerate/">defines three groups</a>: Super Passives, Explorers and Tiptoers.
</p>
<p>
Super Passives aren't looking at all. Explorers are interested in hearing about opportunities but aren't actively looking. They would only take a new position if it was a major career move. Tiptoers are just starting to look by quietly contacting former coworkers to see if there is anything interesting, but they would only move for a much better job.
</p>
<p>
I think any pitch I write should be focused on Explorers and Tiptoers. 
</p>

<p>
What this research doesn't tell me is whether explorers and tiptoers are happy at their job, and this really matters. It's much easier to write a pitch for someone who is deeply dissatisfied because I can hook them with empathy and then explain how I will take their pain away. But what is one to do with people that are happy enough where they are?
</p>
<p>
I think I have to assume these folks are not unhappy with their job. It seems unlikely that an Explorer or a Tiptoer is profoundly unhappy with their career. It seems more likely that these are successful people making carefully considered career moves. 
</p>
<p>
What I can conclude from this is filling my list with very talented developers will be really hard. I'm not solving a big pain point. I could play to ego or some sense of entitlement. "Amazing developers like you deserve amazing career opportunities." But I don't think I should go that route. Or maybe I'm solving some sort of career optimisation problem, "Most people never find their dream job." I think I'll head in this direction. Either way the pitch is not very strong. Hopefully the situation on the hiring side is better or I'll need to work on something else.
