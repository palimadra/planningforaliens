After 30 days of following my <a href="/blog/2013/01/16/n=1/">simple food diet plan</a> I have lost 4 pounds. This was calculated using a statistical average to smooth out the swings. I also lost two inches around my waist. I never counted a single calorie and ate as much as I wanted.

There was an adjustment period. I was really low energy in the afternoon for the first few weeks and feeling a little depressed. I was really hungry between meals without snacks, but that went away after about a week. The third week I had a truly terrible showing in my bike class. We were doing one minute intervals. I should have been putting out about 260 watts but I could barely do 190 watts. My legs felt like rubber. I was seriously questioning the diet at that point. But last weekend I was completely back to normal.

I'll probably tweak my dinner because I am extremely bored of eating squash. Plus Alaskan wild caught salmon is expensive. And I'm going to toy around with adding in some potatoes on tough exercise days. I'm also considering doing a few intermittent fasting days again just to speed the process along. But I'm happy with the results and am going to stick with this for another month with a few minor adjustments.
