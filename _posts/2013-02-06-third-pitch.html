I am teaching myself the art of the long-form sales letter or what I'm calling the long-form pitch. In two attempts I have completely failed to connect with my audience. This is what happened after my third attempt.

<h3>Can a robot find you better jobs than a recruiter?</h3>

<p>I think we all know the answer is yes. Is it because machine learning algorithms are so advanced? Nope. It's because recruiters <span class="italics">suck so bad</span> that even a rudimentary bayesian classifier could probably do a better job.</p>

<h3>Think of it as a job-seeking daemon process that emails you when it finds something good.</h3>
<p>
Tell RecruiterBot what's bothering you. While you're at it, tell him what you want your next job to look like and a few of your favorite programming languages and platforms.
</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: none">
<li>Are you happy with your job but would jump on an opportunity to work with an education startup? RecruiterBot will find that startup.</li>
<li>Are you ready to move up the ladder a step and lead your own team? </li>
<li>Would you love to work for a space rocket company and fling a few things into orbit? RecruiterBot gets it -- space is awesome.</li>
</ul>

<h3>I hate recruiter spam.</h3>
<p>
I've been programming professionally for over seven years. I love programming. My heart beats a little faster every time I open Emacs to start hacking on a new project. I love making stuff that real people use to make their lives better. It's also nice that I never really have to worry about finding a job: my skills are in demand. Being a software developer certainly has its perks. 
</p>
<p>
But if my skills are in such demand, why do recruiters send me such shitty job opportunities? Most of the time the stuff I get is about one level above pure spam. I think there are a few reasons, but one of the main reasons is they are not programmers and they don't know what we want. 
</p>
<p>
I can't put an end to all recruiter spam, but I can promise this:
<ul style="list-style-type: none">
  <li>1. Any email you get from RecruiterBot will contain an awesome job that should at least perk your interest attention</li>
  <li>2. Every email will be  written with the care and attention to detail that could only come from RecruiterBot.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>I for one welcome our recruiting robot overlords.</p>
