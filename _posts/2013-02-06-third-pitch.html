title: "the long-form pitch: part three"
blurb: "I am teaching myself the art of the long-form sales letter or what I'm calling the long-form pitch. In two attempts I have completely failed to connect with my audience. This is what happened after my third attempt."

<h2>Finally something worked.</h2>

<p> After this rewrite I got unanimous positive feedback. Each person I sent it to thought the service was designed for them and each person offered suggestions for features they would like to add. So at the very least I have a pretty good mental representation of a great developer that is not actively looking for a job. I'm in their heads! The next step is driving traffic to a real landing page. I think I'll split test with the second version just to see what happens.

<h2>Update on other fronts.</h2>
<p>
I've been doing customer interviews with business owners that are actively hiring developers. Not surprisingly what I thought would be an interesting offer is not resonating with anyone. I'm apparently incapable of coming up with a pitch that is interesting to people on my first try. :-) So I'm going through the same iterative process on that end and I'll write something up about it.

<h2>I may not want to work on this particular problem.</h2>

<p>
I am still undecided on whether I will actually launch this business. Is this a problem I want to work on? Will I be able to create the kind of business that I want to own (leans heavily on software, challenging, makes boatloads of money, output not tied directly to my time, etc)? I need some sort of go/no-go decision framework. I'll probably write something up about that just to help me think things through.

<h2>The third and seemingly successful pitch.</h2>

<h3>Can a robot find you better jobs than a recruiter?</h3>

<p>Yes of course it can. But is it because we live in the future and machine learning algorithms are so advanced? Nope. It's because <span class="italics">recruiters suck so bad</span> that even a rudimentary bayesian classifier could probably do a better job.</p>

<p>I for one welcome our recruiting robot overlords.</p>

<h3>RecruiterBot hates recruiter spam (and resents being called rudimentary).</h3>
<p>
RecuiterBot's creators are amazing programmers. Just like you they love programming. RecruiterBot's biosensors register a slight uptick in heart beats per minute when they open Emacs to start hacking on a new project. They are not worried about finding a job because their skills are in demand.
</p>
<p>
Why do recruiters send such shitty job opportunities to such amazing humans? Most of the time the stuff is about one level above pure spam. Why? It's because <span class="italics">they are not programmers and they don't know what you are looking for</span>.
</p>

<h3>RecruiterBot is a job-seeking daemon process that emails you when it finds something good.</h3>
<p>
Tell RecruiterBot what's bothering you. While you're at it, tell RecruiterBot what you want your next job to look like and a few of your favorite programming languages and platforms. RecruiterBot is a great listener.
</p>
<p>
RecruiterBot will seek and find what you are looking for and shoot you an email when he finds a job that looks good. If you're interested he'll introduce you to the employer and you take it from there.
</p>
<h3>Here are some ideas.</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: none">
  <li>Would you love to work for a space rocket company and fling a few things into orbit? (RecruiterBot gets it -- space is awesome)</li>
  <li>Are you happy with your job but would jump on an opportunity to work with an education startup?</li>
  <li>Are you ready to move up the ladder and lead your own team? </li>
  <li>Do you want to work with developers that are way better than you and super-charge your learning curve? 
</ul>
<h3>We can't put an end to all recruiter spam...</h3>
<p>but we can promise this:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: none">
  <li>1. Any email you get from RecruiterBot will contain an awesome job.</li>
  <li>2. Every email will be  written with the care and attention to detail that could only come from a robot.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
RecruiterBot is still in invitation-only Beta. Put your email in this little form here and we will let you know when we can fork an instance of RecruiterBot just for you.
