For the past three weeks I've been exploring small business ideas. I've decided it's time I took a serious look at making an info product.
</p>

<h2>
What's an info product?
</h2>

<p>
A book. A series of video lectures. A well-designed pdf. An info product is something people buy to learn new things. If done right an info product can create a tidy profit in a short amount of time. Compare this to subscription based revenue which is more stable but takes a long time to grow.
</p>
<p>
If I'm honest with myself I have not had a tremendous amount of business success with my side projects. I've created cool things and learned a ton about programming and product development, but I've made zero dollars with the "make something cool that you want" approach. It's time to shake things up.
</p>
<p>
If I'm going to make a long-term career move towards making and selling software products I should make long-term plans. Jumping straight into a software-as-a-service product is an unnecessarily aggressive timeline. Especially when the biggest gap in my knowledge is not in product development, it's in picking a profitable idea, marketing and selling. So I should work on something where I'm putting most of my effort into these things and an info product seems like a great place to start. Plus, a small success here would give me the confidence and cash to try something more ambitious later.
</p>

<h2>I finally take the hint.</h2>
<p>
At my job we generally don't hire people with programming experience. I am one of the few exceptions. What this means is we hire a cohort of smart, shiny new college grads every year and throw them at our code base. Most of them don't enjoy the process and leave after a year or two or find a different career path within the company.A few of them find they enjoy programming and stick around. Even though most of these folks move on we need to get them up to speed quickly so they can at least contribute on our projects. Over the years I've become pretty good at this.

While doing research for RecruiterBot I kept running into people wondering how to get started with web development or programming in general. A few of the businesses I talked with even mentioned recruiting talent from one of the local "learn Ruby on Rails in 8 weeks" courses. My friends are always asking me for help in learning how to program or how to get started making this cool idea they had. At some point last week I decided to take a hint: maybe this is a business opportunity that my unique work situation has prepared me to take advantage of?
</p>

<h2>
Web Apps From the Beginning.
</h2>

<p>
Thousands of people are learning to program or have already learned to program. But what they know is just a small slice of a much bigger pie. My experience at work tells me that it's very important for new developers to have a complete mental model of the full stack they are working with or they will run into walls very quickly.
<p>
Imagine you are a mason and know only how to work with one kind of brick and one kind of mortar and can only build plain, flat walls. What happens when you need an arch over your window? What kind of brick makes sense for your facade? Should the foundation be made out of brick? Why are you even using brick in the first place? Is it just because all you know about is brick?
</p>
<p>
Many new developers find themselves in this situation. They learn rudimentary Ruby on Rails skills so they can quickly throw up a basic page, but reality quickly grows too complicated for what you can do with Getting Started With Rails screencasts and copy-pasting jquery snippets. You need to know Ruby, you need to know about HTTP and Javascript and HTML and CSS, etc. It's impossible to make good decisions without at least a rudimentary understanding of all the pieces that go into making a good web application. Mastery of each piece is not necessary but a complete mental model is crucial.
</p>
<p>
What I plan to offer is a complete walkthrough of a typical web application from HTTP request to response. I will offer an option to build and launch your own web application. Developers will write an HTTP server, templating language, URL router and a rudimentary ORM (this is speculative, it sounds too ambitious, still working on the contents). They will also learn how to deploy their app and how to put their code on Github. They will end up with something they can point at and say, "I built that completely from the ground up and I understand everything that went into it."
