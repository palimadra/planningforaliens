  <h2>Web design is hard.</h2>
  <p>
  I am not a designer, I'm a developer. I recently decided my projects would benefit from more thoughtful, informed design so I'm learning a few design skills. I spent the last two weeks reading hundreds of articles on Smashing magazine and .Net magazine. I bought and read <a href="//bootstrappingdesign.com">Bootstrapping Design</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Typographic-Style-Robert-Bringhurst/dp/0881791326">The Elements of Typographic Design</a>. Then I put a few of my newly acquired skills to use redesigning this blog.

  The result is what you are looking at now. It's fully responsive and works on every device and browser I could think of to test, <span class="note">It even works in IE6 and IE7. It just falls back to the mobile version.</span> It took me five days, which took me completely by surprise. Building a website for every possible screen and browser is not a simple task. And for me at least I couldn't separate code and design, I had to do both at the same time. I can't imagine creating a psd for every breakpoint -- how would you even figure out what the breakpoints are? It's a brave new world out there and I can't imagine working on a team with designers that can't code.

  The rest of this post is a walkthrough of my design process. If you're new to responsive web design this might be a good place to start. My blog is completely open source and available on <a href="//github.com/sfioritto/planningforaliens">Github</a>. And while I'm new to design I'm not new to front-end development and I love helping people learn about programming. So get in touch on <a href="//twitter.com/sfioritto">Twitter</a> if you have any questions. But honestly the code is pretty straightforward -- nothing fancy. This was mainly an exercise in learning a little more about design.

  <h2>Typography first.</h2>

  This is a blog, so readability should be the first thing I think about when designing, and that means typography.
