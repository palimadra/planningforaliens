  <h2>My brain is all asplody</h2>
  <p>
  This is what tends to happen when Patrick McKenzie, Amy Hoy, Brennan Dunn, Nathan Barry and Marc-Andr√© Cournoyer do a teardown of your landing page in front of forty other bootstrappers. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Last week I flew out to Philladelphia for Baconbiz Conference. At the end of the conference we had a few hours left in the schedule so Patrick McKenzie suggested we do some teardowns. I threw my hand in the air and the next thing I knew my landing page for <a href="http://www.sketchingwithcss.com">Sketching with CSS</a> was up there for everyone to see.
  </p>
  <p>
  I spent the next twenty minutes madly scribbling barely decipherable notes. <span class="note">I swear one of my notes reads, "Homefit, do you have this pan". I've yet to parse that.</span>And now that I've had some time to digest everything, (and interpret my scrawl), in the spirit of Baconbiz and the community Amy is trying to start, here is my new landing page and how I got there.
  </p>
  <p>
  <a href="http://www.sketchingwithcss.com/old">The old landing page.</a>
  </p>
  <p>
  <a href="http://www.sketchingwithcss.com">The new landing page.</a>

  <h2>I am a developer, not a designer</h2>
  <p>
  When my landing page hit the big screen at the conference the designers in the audience and on the panel recoiled in horror. There were myriad problems.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The color blue is low contrast on white. Plus people will think it's a link.</li>
    <li>The white text in the black box is too much contrast and uncomfortable to read.</li>
    <li>Get rid of the black box.</li>
    <li>The word "Sketch" needs to be the same color as the rest of the text. Otherwise it reads like: "Write css as fast as you can. SKETCH."</li>
    <li>Too much spacing around the sign up form.</li>
    <li>Point out somewhere that you are not a designer.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  I think I've fixed most of these problems. I eliminated the blue text and the black box. There is much less space around the signup form, (in both locations). I also played with the spacing of the headers and paragraphs.
  </p>
  <p>
  The new design is pretty boring but it's job is to be good enough to get out of the way of a potential reader for my book. There are so many ways it could look better, but it's good enough.
  </p>

<div class="section">
  <h2>"Say why they want the thing sooner"</h2>
  <p>
  </p>
  <h2>"Climbing the ladder of abstraction"</h2>
  <p>
  
  </p>
  <p>
  Of course this is just an hypothesis. But it is based on research that I did before even picking a topic for my book. Here are a few examples of articles I read that pointed me to this problem:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.sazzy.co.uk/2012/02/why-i-cant-design-in-the-browser/">I can't design in the browser</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.andybudd.com/archives/2012/03/designing_in_the_browser_is_not_the_answ/">Designing in the browser is not the answer</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/what-to-do-when-you-cant-design-in-the-browser">What to do when you can't design in the browser</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.netmagazine.com/opinions/keep-it-creative">Keep it creative</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://css-tricks.com/i-cant-design-in-the-browser/">Chris Coyier can't design in the browser either</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  These articles, and especially the comments, heavily influenced the copy of the first three points on my original landing page, which are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>You've tried designing in the browser but it kills your creativity.</li>
    <li>You just can't get into the flow when you are coding.</li>
    <li>You feel a little guilty. All the awesome people in our industry design in the browser.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>The confusion</h2>
  <p>
  After all of that research and painstakingly choosing my copy, imagine my surprise when the panel couldn't figure out what problem I was solving with my book.
  </p>
  <p>
  After years of making landing pages for various wacky ideas and getting pummeled with brutal feedback on Reddit and Hacker News you'd think I'd have a tolerance for this sort of thing. I mean, I no longer take it personally and I certainly don't get defensive, but quite frankly I was downright annoyed with myself that the benefit of my book wasn't extremely obvious. <em>How am I not a freaking expert at landing pages by now?</em> Arg.
  </p>
  <p>
  But of course if it's not obvious, it's not obvious, no matter how much research I did. So, how do I fix this? How do I rectify all of the research I did with this expert feedback?
  </p>

  <h2>Climbing down the ladder of abstraction</h2>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
  At some point in the flurry of comments Amy said, "you need to climb down the ladder of abstraction." At about the same time Brennan said, "say why they want the thing sooner" (which is ironically a less abstract way of saying what Amy said). Alright, so I need to get to the point sooner. 
  </p>
  <p>
  My H1 text is very abstract, "Write CSS as fast as you can sketch." 
  </p>
  </p>
</div>
  <p>
  Most of the feedback I got from the panel was stuff I could implement immediately, like changing contrast, making a few copy edits, etc. (and I'll get to those comments shortly, because they are probably relevant to you). But the biggest takeaway for me, and quite frankly the most annoying, was that everyone had a different opinion on what the benefit they would get if they read my book.

I love Gordon Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares. The old, BBC version, not the new American over-edited, reality tv-show. I like to yell advice at the restaurateurs. "Why don't you just do what he says? He's an expert!" "You asked to be on the show, you asked for advice from the expert, now just do exactly what he says!"

If you've seen the show you know it works out almost every time. But for some reason they never just do what he says.

I stumbled into a Kitchen Nightmares situation last week at BaconBiz Conference. I spent a decent chunk of my very limited "start my own thing" stash to fly to Philadelphia and meet with some of the experts I've come to admire over the years. (Restrateur admits he needs help). At the end of the conference Patrick McKenzie suggested doing a few teardowns.(Restrateur sees an opportunity for free consulting). I raised my hand and was selected. (Restrateur gets selected for the show). The expert panel proceeded to destroy my landing page. (Restrateur ignores advice)?

I was in a classic Kitchen Nightmares setup. Wouuld I crack under the pressure? It turns out Gordon Ramsey's producers would have hated me. I didn't fight the advice of the experts and the result is my shiny new landing page. It's a thousand times better than the old version.

"Say why they want the thing sooner." -- Brennan Dunn

You have to read half of the original landing page before you know what's in my book. And if you miraculously cut a swathe through the jungle of shitty writing between you and this important information, you are rewarded with limp and flacid copy. (We'll come back to this point).

The first edit I made was to select the section about the book and move it to the very top. I also added a header, "What you'll get out of this book." Future readers will have no trouble figuring out what's in the book.
