The plan was to land a quiet, easy day job and work on building a software business on the side until I was making enough to quit. After five years, the plan was clearly not working. Total boredom during the day, customer development phone calls at lunch, grinding away at code at night &mdash; passion and enthusiasm dry up quickly when nobody cares about what you are doing.

The day-job-pays-for-side-projects plan failed. So I quit my job.


Humility
--------------------

I wrote a
[blog post](http://twosixes.wordpress.com/2010/05/24/bumps-in-the-road/)
back in 2010 with a big list of my failed "businesses". Ironically, that
post is on the blog I was running for my last failed business.

At some point you have to admit you don't know how to start a
business. So I admitted to myself I didn't have a clue about business
and I needed to educate myself.

The new plan was to treat the next year like I was working on a
graduate degree for entrepreneurship.

The best professors ever
------------------------------

Since I was making my own graduate degree, I could pick whatever
professors I wanted. After searching long and hard, I decided Amy
Hoy's 30X500 class for entrepreneurs was exactly what I was looking
for.

This decision was multifaceted, but the main deciding factor was I was
not interested in creating a Silicon Valley, YCombinator, lean
startup-y thing. Startups are about a product. "My augmented reality
glasses will revolutionize the world" or "Our web application will disrupt the pet
industry" or ... whatever, you get the point. It's all about me, me,
me, our product, our vision, etc.

Businesses start with a customer, startups start with a product.
Startups fail most of the time and I think it's because they start
with a product and try to find a market. If you are interested in
making money, this is backwards. If you start with people and invest
time understanding their lives and daily aches and pains, and as long
as you can actually create a pretty good product, you will make
money. It's almost guaranteed.

At this point in my career as an entrepreneur, I was pretty geared up
for maximizing my chances of success. No moonshots for me. So I decided to start with
customers, not a product. When I quit my job and people asked me what
my business was going to be, I said, "It will be for web designers,
that's all I know."

30X500 is almost completely about empathy and how to have some for
your customers. So it's pretty much a guarantee you will make money. I
signed up.

The rest of my story, and how I grew my list to over 3,000 people and made over $15,000, is really just me
executing what I learned in 30X500 to the best of my ability. 

What customers do you want
------------------------------

If you start with customers, then the first step is to pick the customers you want.

I wanted my customers to have money and to be inclined to spend it. They
should also be working on things I'm interested in, so I don't get too
bored making stuff for them later (because it gets boring fast, just
trust me on this). They should also hang out on the web, otherwise I
would have no idea how to reach them.

There are other qualifications, but these are the
most important.

In retrospect, I should have picked web developers, or Python
developers or Javascript developers &mdash; all things that I am. But I
picked web designers and I am not a web designer. Oops.

It's easier to relate to people when you've already been in their
shoes, so it's easier to market to them, easier to understand their
problems and easier to identify pains that are big enough for you to
solve and charge money for.

Research, research, research
------------------------------

The next step is to really understand your customers and what they are
struggling with every day. Look for pain, anguish, guilt, frustration,
etc. Take the pain away ... $$$.

(Don't do customer interviews. I used to do
these, but people lie (usually to be nice). Just go read what they are saying on the sites
they hang out on, this will be much more truthy.)

The hardest part about the research phase for me was to not get distracted by
product ideas. I was always tempted by articles or comments where
people were asking specifically for software and then I'd start
dreaming about how I would make it, how much I'd charge, etc. This is
totally not the time to do that.

I read hundreds, probably thousands of articles and forum threads
until I finally felt like I was finding some patterns. Here is
[one example](http://www.sazzy.co.uk/2012/02/why-i-cant-design-in-the-browser/comment-page-1/)
out of many articles I found filled with really frustrated people. I wanted to help them!

Sketching with CSS is born
------------------------------

You don't have to write software to solve someone's problem. There are
other kinds of
products. [Sketching with CSS](http://www.sketchingwithcss.com/) is a
book/video/info product thing. It felt weird to me to start a
company and not write software. Software is what I do. But given all
of my past failures I really wanted to do something small, that I
could finish quickly. 

Once I decided on my customers, (web designers), pain, (designing in
the browser is frustrating/infuriating/limiting/etc), and a solution,
(an ebook with videos), I created a landing page and started growing
my email list.

Only 15 email addresses, what am I doing wrong?
------------------------------

I put my new landing page on the web_design subreddit and I got 15
email addresses. Ouch. I think four of them were my mom using fake email
addresses just to make me feel better.

As it turns out, entrepreneurship is a grind. I'm much better at
growing my list now, but even still there is never a magic moment
where everything becomes easy. I'll spend a day writing a blog post
like this and usually net a couple hundred email addresses. It's
better than 15 but man, would my life be better if it was 10,000. I've
given up on that ever happening.

I now have over 3,000 people on my mailing list, a far cry
from 15. How did I do it?

This is where all of the research I did really paid off. First, I
uncovered many great blog post ideas as I was reading articles and
comment threads, so I have a pretty big list of ideas. Also, as a
result of my research, I know where web designers hang out. So all I
do is pick a topic from my list, write a really good blog post and
then share it in all of the places where I know my customers hang
out.

And I put an email sign up form at the bottom of every post. 

Write blog post, promote it everywhere.I did that over, and over, and over, and over ...

A few tactics for growing your list
------------------------------

* You don't have to write blog posts. The most successful thing I did
for growing my mailing list was the
[Ultimate Flexbox Cheat Sheet](http://www.sketchingwithcss.com/samplechapter/cheatsheet.html).

* Give away a chapter. I
[did that](http://www.sketchingwithcss.com/samplechapter/cheatsheet.html)
and snagged 500 email addresses.

* Write guest posts. I wrote
[one big guest post](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2013/11/18/the-future-of-video-in-web-design/)
for Smashing Magazine and it resulted in another 500 email
addresses. I plan to guest post more this year.

* Add a sweetener. Give something away for free in exchange for an email
address. I give away an interactive video course all about
flexbox. People love the course and the email forms convert really
well. I use Nathan Barry's [ConvertKit](https://convertkit.com/) to
deliver the course then move those emails over to MailChimp from time
to time.

Finish it
------------------------------

I underestimated the amount of work it would take to write a book and
create hours of screencasts, all while writing blog posts to grow my
email list. I am not a fast wrtier. If you can crank out a blog post
in an hour or two, instead of the day it takes me, you will finish
much more quickly than I did.

I was writing and promoting for 6 months. A far cry from Nathan's
turnaround time of 3 months. Structuring and prioritizing your time is
a skill and apparently years of corporate dronehood had atrophied
this particular skill for me. Plus I'm slow at writing.

But whatever, my excuses don't matter. Instead the takeaway for you
should be to start with an even smaller project than Sketching with
CSS. Maybe you are good at structuring and prioritizing your time but
chances are you will run into another skill bottleneck.

Product scope is like a multiplier for all of your faults, so pick something small.

Launch it
------------------------------

There is an art to launching a product, and I do not have
it. Fortunately it is a skill that can be learned, and I am working on
it. If you haven't launched a product before, you are probably bad at
it. All the more reason to do a small product; so you can learn how to
launch it.

I launched [Sketching with CSS](http://www.sketchingwithcss.com/)
twice. The first launch I announced pre-orders to a list of
about 1000. The second launch was when the book was finished and I
launched to 3,111 people.

On the first launch I made about $5,000 in two days. Since the second
launch was to a list that was three times as big, I expected to make about
twice as much (factoring in some people on the list had already
pre-ordered). Instead I only made $5,000. Oops. I clearly messed up my
launch.

After chatting with Amy Hoy on Skype about it, I learned that I had
failed to build anticipation for the product. In the second launch I
sent five emails over the course of five days. The emails were
essentially no different than my blog posts. They were useful and
on topics relevant to my audience. My email list loved them. The
problem was I failed to tie the emails back to my product. I barely
mentioned Sketching with CSS until the last email, so I failed to
build anticipation. Oops. 

Fortunately I can launch again, so I'll fix it the next time around.

Skills to be learned
------------------------------

My launch failure highlights one really important lesson I've
learned: entrepreneurship is a skill. If you've never left the "build
cool product" phase then you don't have entrepreneurial skills. Which
is why I think it's crazy to start off with a huge software product
that takes months to create, (especially if you don't know your
customers yet, but I've already covered that).

Launching is a skill. Promotion is a skill. Writing for your audience
is a skill. Learning about your customers is a skill. Empathy is a
skill. Structuring and prioritizing your time is a skill.

You're probably not great at all of these skills, so start small so
you can learn as you grow your business.

One more thing, charge more
------------------------------

You should charge for the value of your product, e.g. my price points
are $39, $99, $249. A $7 ebook is a legit way to make money and build
an audience, but if you're in it to learn, you'll learn more if you
charge based on value.

Let me explain. It takes guts to charge $249 for a book. And because
it's so scary, unless you are a fool, you will really do your research
so you know you are making something worth the price. For me at least,
the price forced me to really know my customers pains inside and
out. 

There's yet another lesson to learn from charging more. Even when you
know it's worth it, even if you know your customers inside and out and
you know your product will solve their pain, it's still really scary
to charge real money for your product. You have to learn how to get
over it, and the only way to learn how to get over the fear is to
... get over the fear. Don't avoid it, don't be a wimp, charge real
money. Charge for the real value of your product, don't undersell
yourself.

Oh, and the more you charge the better your customers, generally
speaking. I love my customers. 

Onward and upward
------------------------------

Since I started selling the book I've been making about $4,000 a
month. Not bad! But not good enough either.

If I can pull this off even after screwing up two launches, picking
too big of a first product and choosing an audience I have a hard time
relating to, you can do it too.

to go where you want them to, you should sign up for my free lesson on
flexbox. It's the future of CSS layout.
