title: "Get Going with Grunt"
blurb: "The Grunt Getting Started guide seems to be missing a few
steps, or at the very least assumes a lot. Here's a quick start guide
with a more details."
author: "sean"
---

In this guide you will install Grunt on OS X, create a new project and
set up tasks for running [autoprefixer](https://github.com/ai/autoprefixer), [Sass](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-sass) and [Livereload](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch) whenever a
file changes.

You can just follow the directions and get up and running quickly, but I've also included some of the
problems I ran into along the way and how I worked around them. I've
done this mostly for the poor soul desparately Googling "No "sass"
targets found". If that's you, maybe you'll find the answer you are
looking for in here.

If you run into any problems along the way or have a suggestion for an
improvement, shoot me an email (sean@planningforaliens.com) or tell me on Twitter
([@sfioritto](https://twitter.com/sfioritto)) so I can update the guide.

NOTE: These directions are specifically for OS X, but if you're on Windows
or Linux, once you get NPM installed the directions should be pretty
similar.

Step 1: Upgrade Xcode, install/reinstall npm
------------------------------

Make sure you have the latest version of Xcode, because if you're like
me your version is ancient. You also need
[npm](https://www.npmjs.org/), (package manager for Node.js), to install grunt and
grunt plugins.

I use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) to install npm. In my case I had to
uninstall and reinstall npm. When I tried to install grunt the first
time, the grunt command was not added to my path, which should have
happened automatically. Rather than forcing it to work, I figured I
must have messed up the initial install of npm, so I reinstalled and
sure enough that fixed the problem.

{% highlight bash %}
brew uninstall npm
brew install npm{% endhighlight %}

Step 2: Install grunt command line tools
------------------------------

In the command line use npm to install the grunt command line tools.

{% highlight bash %}
npm install -g grunt-cli{% endhighlight %}

You may be thinking to yourself, "But wait, I haven't installed grunt
yet. When do I install grunt?"

Grunt is not an application that you install and run in the
background like Codekit. It's just a piece of code that sits in your
project's folder.

You can think of it as a script to help you build your project, and
you need a copy of this script for each of your projects. We'll get to
that part shortly.

Step 2: Install grunt-init
------------------------------

NOTE: I'm assuming you have git installed.

{% highlight bash %}
npm install -g grunt-init
mkdir ~/.grunt-init
git clone https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-init-gruntfile.git ~/.grunt-init/gruntfile{% endhighlight %}

In your project directory, run this command:

{% highlight bash %}
grunt-init gruntfile {% endhighlight %}

Answer the questions like so:

</figure>

After reading the docs I noticed most of learning "grunt" is setting
up two configuration files, package.json and Gruntfile.js. For my
purposes I just wanted to get up and running quickly, so I started
searching around for basic templates of these two files I could use
instead of creating them by hand. That's where grunt-init comes in.

The grunt-init plugin is like a little mini-framework in and of
itself. You can start all kinds of projects, but the 'gruntfile'
project is the most basic I could find, so you'll start with that.

The downside of using grunt-init is there is a bunch of extra stuff
in the config files you don't need, and it created a few extra
headaches. But this is a "Getting Started" guide, not "Learn
everything about Grunt" guide, so moving on.

Step 3: "Install" grunt
------------------------------

In your project's directory, run this command:

{% highlight bash %}
npm install grunt --save-dev{% endhighlight %}

If you'll recall, this doesn't actually "install" grunt, it just adds
the grunt "script" to your project. You'll have to do this for each
project.

(There's probably a good way to share grunt configurations accross projects
easily, but I didn't look into it).

Step 4: Add autoprefixer
------------------------------

In your project's directory:

{% highlight bash %}
npm install grunt-autoprefixer --save-dev{% endhighlight %}

Open up Gruntfile.js, (it's in your project directory, you created it
when you ran grunt-init), and find the section toward the bottom with
the "loadNpmTasks" function calls and add a task:

{% highlight javascript %}
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-watch');{% endhighlight %}


Step 5: Sass and Grunt Watch
------------------------------

In your project directory, install the Sass plugin and Grunt Watch with npm:

{% highlight bash %}
npm install grunt-sass --save-dev 
npm install grunt-contrib-watch --save-dev {% endhighlight %}

And just like with autoprefixer, add it to your Gruntfile.

{% highlight javascript %}
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-watch');
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-sass');{% endhighlight %}

Step 6: Remove extra junk from Gruntfile.js
------------------------------

At this point the Gruntfile generated by grunt-init becomes a
liability. There are a few things you have to remove, otherwise grunt
won't run.

Remove these lines:

{% highlight javascript %}
grunt-contrib-concat
grunt-contrib-uglify
grunt-contrib-qunit
grunt-contrib-jshint{% endhighlight %}

If you don't remove these lines and try to run grunt, you'll warnings
like

{% highlight bash %}
"Aborted due to warnings"{% endhighlight %}

or

{% highlight bash %}
Warning: Task "jshint" not found. Use --force to continue.{% endhighlight %}


Step 7: tweak the watch section
------------------------------

In Gruntfile.js, change this line:

{% highlight javascript %}
grunt.registerTask('default',['jshint', 'qunit', 'concat', 'uglify']);{% endhighlight %}

To this:

{% highlight javascript %}
grunt.registerTask('default', ['watch', 'autoprefixer', 'sass']);{% endhighlight %}

Make your watch section look like this, (you will have to delete some
sections):

{% highlight javascript %}
watch: {
    sass: {
        files: ['*.scss'],
        tasks: ['sass', 'autoprefixer'],
        options: {
            spawn: false,
            livereload: true
        }
    },
    html: {
        files: ['*.html'],
        options: {
            spawn: false,
            livereload: true
        }
    }
}{% endhighlight %}

The sass section says whenever a .scss file changes, run the Sass task then
the autoprefixer task and then trigger a livereload of the
browser. The HTML section is there so whenever an HTML file changes,
the browser will livereload.

Step 394: Configuration
------------------------------

Okay okay, it's only step 8 but it sure feels like more.

You need to configure the Sass and autoprefixer plugins. For my
project all of my .scss files live in the top directory of the project
and I compile them into the same folder. Autoprefixed css will go into
a css folder.

So in the initConfig section of the Gruntfile.js, add this, (make
adjustments as necessary, I only have one .scss file, main.scss):

{% highlight javascript %}
sass: {
        dist: {
            files: {
                'main.css': 'main.scss'
            }
        }
    }{% endhighlight %}

Then add this for autoprefixer:

{% highlight javascript %}
 autoprefixer: {
            // prefix all files
            multiple_files: {
                expand: true,
                flatten: true,
                src: '*.css', 
                dest: 'css/'
            }
        },
{% endhighlight %}

You can do set this up differently, and you probably will, this is a
pretty dumb setup but I just needed to get something working for a
quick one-off demo. Bigger projects deserve more thought.

Step 9: live reload
------------------------------

Livereload is already configured in Grunt if you followed the
directions up to this point. But you still have to either add a script
tag to your html, setup some sort of Grunt middleware to add the tag
as a watch task or install an extension.

{% highlight html %}
<script src="//localhost:35729/livereload.js"></script>{% endhighlight %}

The problem with the script is you have to remove it before you deploy
the production version of your project. Pretty easy if you are using
some sort of template language, but not easy with pure HTML. There's
something called 'middleware'
[you can install](https://github.com/intesso/connect-livereload), but
I just added the
[livereload extension](https://github.com/intesso/connect-livereload)
to Chrome.

Step 10: Run Grunt
------------------------------

In your project directory, enter the command 'grunt'. Hit enter. It
should look something like this:

<figure>
    <img src="/images/grunt/start-grunt.png" />
</figure>


Download my Gruntfile
------------------------------

Can't get it to work? Compare your Gruntfile with [mine](/examples/gruntfile.js). and see if
there are any obvious differences.


Conclusion
------------------------------

A few months ago I wrote a little essay for [my newsletter](http://www.planningforaliens.com/the-invasion/) that maybe
you shouldn't use Grunt. For 30 bucks you could just
grab [Codekit](https://incident57.com/codekit/) and be compiling Sass and live-reloading your projects in
a matter of minutes. Compare that to the convoluted first experience
of Grunt. Is it worth it?

Hopefully this little guide saved you a few hours of fruitless
googling! And if you like this and want more like it, [sign up for my newsletter](http://www.planningforaliens.com/the-invasion/).
