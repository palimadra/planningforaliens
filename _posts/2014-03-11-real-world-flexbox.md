I've been
[writing about](http://www.sketchingwithcss.com/samplechapter/) and
[teaching flexbox](http://www.sketchingwithcss.com/flexbox-tutorial/)
for a while now and the most common question I am asked is, "when will
support be good enough for me to use flexbox in a real project?"

In this article we will explore options for using flexbox starting
with the best case scenario and working our way down to IE8.

The demo we'll be using is the sign up page for a [little side project](http://www.pagesnap.io/)
a [friend of mine](https://twitter.com/zrail) is working on. He ran
into a few layout problems using Bootstrap's grid system that are
easily solved with flexbox, so it's a great example. Here's the basic,
ideal layout we'll be working with.

The code for the examples is on Github [here](https://github.com/sfioritto/real-world-flexbox).

You only need to support bleeding edge browsers
------------------------------

When I look at traffic logs for any of my sites, IE doesn't really
exist. About 1% of my traffic is IE10/11. My
[blog](http://www.planningforaliens.com/) and
[product pages](http://www.sketchingwithcss.com/) are made for web
developers like you, so I only need to support the latest, bleeding
edge browsers people like us tend to be running.

If your traffic looks like this, you can use flexbox today, right now,
with a few caveats:

* Don't use flex-wrap, (not supported in Firefox until version 28)
* Use the -webkit prefix
* Don't use it for  [overall page layout](http://jakearchibald.com/2014/dont-use-flexbox-for-page-layout/)

Follow these rules and you should be good to go.

With these rules in mind, let's write the layout code for the
example. I'm only going to explain some of the flexbox CSS for the
example &mdash; just the stuff that might be confusing.

The top box with the different pricing plans is a flex
container. Pete wants the buttons to be lined up at the
bottom. If the outer container is a flex container with align-items
set to stretch, (the default), then all of the boxes will have equal
height and it's easy to put the buttons at the bottom.

{% highlight css %}
.plans {
  display: flex; }{% endhighlight %}

Then each of the pricing tiers is also a flex container. You have to
change the direction to column and align items to flex-start,
otherwise the buttons stretch to fill the horizontal space.

{% highlight css %}
.plans > div {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: flex-start; }{% endhighlight %}

All that's left is to put the buttons at the bottom of each
section. The easiest thing to do is select each of the buttons and
then set margin-top: auto.

{% highlight css %}
.plans > div a {
  margin-top: auto; }{% endhighlight %}

I used flexbox in a few other spots on the page in similar ways but
since I'm assuming you know flexbox already, I'm not going to go into
more detail here. You can look at the code for this example [here](https://github.com/sfioritto/real-world-flexbox/tree/master/demos/latest_syntax_only).

You have very little IE traffic
------------------------------

Even with only a trickle of traffic from older browsers, it's likely you'll want IE10 and Firefox 25 or
older to work.

If you combine the previous versions of flexbox with the latest syntax, you bring IE10 and older
versions of Firefox, Safari and Opera into the fold. (Check out
[caniuse](http://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox) for more detail on
supported browsers).

It is tedious to write the syntax for every version of
flexbox plus all of the prefixes, so instead use [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/ai/autoprefixer). If
you're not already using Grunt/Gulp/makefiles, whatever,
this will
[get you started with Grunt and Autoprefixer](http://www.planningforaliens.com/blog/2014/03/07/grunt/).

With this approach, don't use auto margins since that doesn't seem to
work in every version. Also be sure to test thoroughly in IE10 where I've noticed a
few bugs. For example, in the code for the demo I had to set the
width to 100% on the paragraph above the buttons otherwise the text
spilled out of the containers for some reason, (without auto
margins, I had to flex this paragraph to push the buttons to the
bottom).

To give you some sense of the code generated by autoprefixer, here's
the code generated for the pricing packages section.

{% highlight css %}
.plans {
  display: -webkit-box;
  display: -webkit-flex;
  display: -ms-flexbox;
  display: flex; }
  .plans > div {
    -webkit-box-flex: 1;
    -webkit-flex: 1 1 33%;
    -ms-flex: 1 1 33%;
    flex: 1 1 33%;
    display: -webkit-box;
    display: -webkit-flex;
    display: -ms-flexbox;
    display: flex;
    -webkit-box-orient: vertical;
    -webkit-box-direction: normal;
    -webkit-flex-direction: column;
    -ms-flex-direction: column;
    flex-direction: column;
    -webkit-box-align: start;
    -webkit-align-items: flex-start;
    -ms-flex-align: start;
    align-items: flex-start; }
    .plans > div .stretch {
      width: 100%;
      -webkit-box-flex: 1;
      -webkit-flex: 1 0 auto;
      -ms-flex: 1 0 auto;
      flex: 1 0 auto; }{% endhighlight %}

With Autoprefixer, you get this automatically, so you just write the
latest syntax, and an extra bonus is you get this for all of your CSS,
not just flexbox. 

You have to support IE8, but it doesn't have to look as nice
------------------------------

Most clients and bosses want their website to look the same in every
supported browser, but a few of us have bosses that buy into
progressive enhancement.

In this case, progressive enhancement doesn't necessarily mean IE8
users get a single column of content. You can use old style layout
hand in hand with flexbox. When applicable, flexbox will takeover but
browsers that don't support it will just ignore the flexbox layout and
fall back to the old style layout.

Zoe Gillenwater did a great presentation on this a few months back, [here's a
link to her presentation](http://zomigi.com/blog/flexbox-presentation/).

For our example, we'll give up on the buttons being lined up at the
bottom in IE8 and IE9, just to keep it simple. But we still need the
pricing section to line up horizontally, so we can use floats.

{% highlight css %}
.plans > div {
  width: 33%;
  float: left;
  flex: 1 1 0;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: flex-start; }{% endhighlight %}

(Note:I'm showing only the latest flexbox syntax here, but this code is
autoprefixed in the live demo)

The flex-direction is set to column, but each of the elements in the
plan section is a block element, so it stacks in a column already so
we don't need to do anything there.

The signup box is also a flex container, so we set the width and the
display properties.

{% highlight css %}
.well form .inputs #email {
  width: 50%;
  display: inline;
  flex: 1 0 auto; }
.well form .inputs .btn {
  width: 250px;
  width: 25rem;
  margin-left: 16px;
  margin-left: 1rem; }{% endhighlight %}

The footer is also a flexbox, but you get the idea at this point. Here
is what it looks like in IE8.

You have to support IE8 and 9 and it needs to look exactly they same.
------------------------------

If you find yourself in this category, you may not want to use
flexbox. You're not completely out of luck, but the options available to
you are not great.

There is a flexbox polyfill called
[flexie.js](https://github.com/doctyper/flexie), it only works with
one of the older syntaxes, not the new syntax. You might be thinking
you could just use Autoprefixer and then load flexie.js for IE9 and
older, but it doesn't work.

There are a few problems. The first is flexie.js looks for
unprefixed CSS but Autoprefixer does not generate unprefixed CSS for
the old syntax, probably because it's not used by any browser.

You can get around this problem by patching flexie.js, but you're
still not out of the woods. Flexie.js is buggy when you have flexbox
rules within media queries, which you probably will. Part of the
problem is flexie.js has a hardcoded version of Selectivizr which
[doesn't work with respond.js](http://selectivizr.com/tests/respond/).

Until it's fixed, (if ever), the only solution I can think of is to create an
IE8/9 only stylesheet with the old, unprefixed flexbox syntax.

Even then you can't just use flexbox and expect everything to
work. You definitely can't use auto margins. You have to keep the layout as
simple as possible. I found I couldn't always get the old flexbox
syntax to do exactly the same thing as the new, especially with the
polyfill.

But if you aren't using media queries, with a little love you can get
flexbox to work back to IE8.

In the [example code](https://github.com/sfioritto/real-world-flexbox/tree/master/demos/flexie)
there is a copy of the patched version of flexie.js I used. I
did the quickest thing possible to get it to work &mdash; don't use it
in production. If you find yourself needing flexie.js in production,
do everyone a favor and put together a real patch and send it to
[the author](https://twitter.com/doctyper) of flexie.js.

Polyfill for the modern syntax
------------------------------

What we really need is a polyfill for the modern syntax. The good news
is Richard Herrera, the guy who wrote flexie.js, is
[working on it](https://github.com/doctyper/reflexie/tree/develop). But
it's not even close to being finished.

Learn the new flexbox syntax
------------------------------

The new flexbox syntax hasn't been stable for very long, so not a lot
of us know it yet. If you've been thinking of adding it to your web
development arsenal, I've got the perfect thing for you.

I've been working on a [free course for flexbox](http://www.sketchingwithcss.com/flexbox-tutorial/), this just happens to
be the last lesson in the series. So if you liked this and you want to
