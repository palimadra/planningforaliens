In [part one](blog/2015/01/15/github-ghost-towns/) you learned why you should work on a side project.

How to pick a side project and then actually finish it
------------------------------

The purpose of your side project is to build a portable reputation. You are not doing something to learn a new thing and put it on your resume. You will likely end up with a new thing to put on your resume, but that's not *why* you are making something.

Therefore the end result of your side project does not need to be software. For example, a blog post demonstrating expertise is a fantastic way to build a reputation and also a great side project to start with because it's easier to *finish*.

Don't worry, you still get to write code
------------------------------

A blog post can lead to writing software, (I'll show you how), and can even serve double duty as marketing for your software. Marketing isn't evil in this case, it just means people will know about your work, which is important for building a reputation, right?

There are four rules for picking a topic to write about:

* It's related to the field you are trying to build a reputation in (obviously, and I'm assuming web dev/design from here forward)
* Solves a problem or provides insight into something people are struggling with
* The topic is something other web people are talking about
* Requires you do hard work *for* your readers

The rules work equally well for choosing an open source project to create, which is why you may end up with code even though you're starting with a blog post.

Create something valuable and shareable.
------------------------------

The intention behind the rules is to help you create something people will use and are likely to share.

If the topic is something people are talking about, they are more likely to share it because your blog post becomes a part of the discussion.

If the topic requires hard work to write about or code, then the work you are doing will save the community countless hours of drudgery. Nobody likes doing boring work, so this is obviously valuable.

Pick your topic and commit
------------------------------

About a year ago Apple launched the new Mac Pro and a marketing site to go with it. It had some pretty slick animations synchronized with some swooping, evocative video of the new Mac Pro, and everyone wanted to know how it worked.

So I decided to write a blog post, [How the New Mac Pro Site Works](/blog/2013/06/11/mac-pro/). I spent about a day reverse engineering the obfuscated Javascript code and then did a big write up about it. It was a popular post and I did such a good job reverse engineering it I ended up getting a call from an Apple recruiter.

This blog post followed all four of the rules I mentioned above.

* It's related to web design and development
* Everyone was talking about the new Mac Pro site at the time.
* It provided insight into how the whiz-bang developers at Apple had done this cool thing
* I had to do a lot of boring work to reverse engineer the site

Build on what you have
------------------------------

The popularity of the Mac Pro post was a clue that people were interested in synchronizing video and CSS animations. So I came up with an idea for an article and pitched it to Smashing Magazine. I sent them a draft and they decided to [publish it](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/11/18/the-future-of-video-in-web-design/).

And now I'm a writer for Smashing Magazine.

But it doesn't end there. As I was writing the post I realized it would be more valuable if the article walked through an actual code base, so I whipped together a [little library](https://github.com/sfioritto/charlie.js) and put it on Github and mentioned it in the article. Hey presto, there it was, my first open source project actually used by other people.

Now you know why you are creating a side project and how to pick a side project that will accomplish your goals. In part three you'll learn tips and tricks for actually finishing what you start. If you're not already, sign up for the newsletter below to get the next in the series.
