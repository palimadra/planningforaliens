In [part one](blog/2015/01/15/github-ghost-towns/) you learned why you should work on a side project.

How to pick a side project and then actually finish it
------------------------------

The purpose of your side project is to build a portable reputation. You are not doing something to learn a new thing and put it on your resume. You will likely end up with a new thing to put on your resume, but that's not *why* you are making something.

Therefore the end result of your side project does not need to be software. For example, a blog post demonstrating expertise is a fantastic way to build a reputation and also a great side project to start with because it's easier to *finish*.

Don't worry, you still get to write code
------------------------------

A blog post can lead to writing software, (I'll show you how), and can even serve double duty as marketing for your software. Marketing isn't evil in this case, it just means people will know about your work, which is important for building a reputation, right?

There are four rules for picking a topic to write about:

* It's related to the field you are trying to build a reputation in (obviously, and I'm assuming web dev/design from here forward)
* The topic is something other web people are talking about
* Solves a problem or provides insight into something people are struggling with
* Requires you do hard work *for* your readers

These rules work equally well for choosing an open source project to create, which is why you may end up with code even though you're starting with a blog post.

Pick your topic and commit
