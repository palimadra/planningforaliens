      career
    </h3>
    <p>
      Today, I'm an entrepreneur...sweet! For the last five years I worked for an unecessarily secretive and mysterious industrial supply company. Before that I worked for a few years (and way too many hours) for a <a href="http://www.accenture.com">consulting company</a>. I also have one of those fancy degree things in <a href="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/">computer science</a>.

    <h3>
      family
    </h3>
    <p>
      I'm married to the lovely and talented <a href="http://www.bethfioritto.com/">Beth Fioritto</a>. She blogs about teaching in urban schools and overly ambitious home improvement projects <a href="http://bethfioritto.blogspot.com/">here</a>.

    <h3>
      programming
    </h3>
    <p>
      I've been programming since I was 12. That was some time ago. I use Python and Javascript to <a href="https://github.com/sfioritto">make cool things</a>.
