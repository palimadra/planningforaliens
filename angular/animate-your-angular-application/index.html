  <p>
    When an Angular app refreshes the DOM, the default experience
    is jarring
  because Angular dumps the elements into the view with no
    transition. 
  </p>
  <p>
  The good news is Angular comes with great support for
    animations. The bad news is, it might not be exactly what you
    expected. Angular doesn't do animations for you, instead it
    provides events you can hook into with your own, custom animations.
  </p>

  <h2>Understanding $animate and the ngAnimate module</h2>
  
  <p>
    In a non-Angular Javascript app, you write the code that updates
    the DOM, so while you're writing that code you sprinkle in some
    custom animations, NBD. But in an Angular app you're often using
    built-in directives and not mucking around in the DOM <em>directly</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
  So what's a developer to do?
  </p>
  <h3>
    How would animations work in a web application if you weren't using
  Angular?
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    You would:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Define your starting and end styles</li>
    <li>Add or change an element and set it to the starting style</li>
    <li>Animate to the end style</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  And you're either doing this with Javascript or CSS.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you add animations to your Angular application, you follow this
    pattern, but in a very Angular-y way that completely decouples your
animation code from your directive code.
  </p>

  <h3>This is a good thing.</h3>
  <p>
    Angular's built-in directives are pre-wired for animations. What
    that means is you get access to animation "events" which you can
    hook into with either CSS classes or Javascript code. These events
  correspond with adding or removing elements or classes &mdash;
  basically anything that might make sense to animate.
  </p>
  <p>
    That might sound a bit weird to you right now, but the upside is
  you can create your own custom directives and then let end users of
  those directives define their own animations.
  </p>
  <h3>Code reuse FTW.</h3>
  <p>
  This is exactly how Angular designed its own directives. This way
  developers and designers get to choose animations because they aren't
  predefined by Angular. And you can create the animations any way you
  like, with CSS transitions/animations or a Javascript library.
  </p>
  <h2>Build your own directive</h2>
  <p>
    It's easier to understand how all the pieces fit together if you build
    and animate a simple custom directive you write yourself. Then you can circle back and
    understand <em>exactly</em> what's happening in the built-in directives.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here is a simple directive for hiding an element with no support for animations:
  </p>
  
  {% highlight javascript %}
app.controller("example", function($scope){
    $scope.awesome = false;
});
  
app.directive("myHide", function(){
    return {
        restrict: 'A',
        link: function(scope, elem, attrs){
            scope.$watch(attrs.myHide, function(value){
                if (value) {
                    elem.addClass("hide");
                } else {
                    elem.removeClass("hide");
                }
            });
        }
    };
});
  {% endhighlight %}
  
  <p>
    The myHide directive watches an expression, (in this case the
    value of 'awesome'), and when the expression
    evaluates as truthy, adds a class to the element and removes it when
    it's false. The class sets display to none, so the myHide element is
    hidden when the expression is truthy.
  </p>
  
  {% highlight html %}
  <div class="myHideExample" ng-controller="example">
    <div class="message">
      <p my-hide="awesome">Hide this text if awesome</p>
    </div>
    <button class="button" ng-click="awesome = !awesome">Toggle awesomeness</button>
  </div>  
  {% endhighlight %}
  
  <div class="myHideExample" ng-controller="example">
    <div class="message">
      <p my-hide="awesome">Hide this text if awesome</p>
    </div>
    <button class="button" ng-click="awesome = !awesome">Toggle awesomeness</button>
  </div>

  <p>
    This works, but there is no transition, it just pops in and out of existence.
  </p>

  <h2>Add an animation to this directive without $animate</h2>
  <p>
  Since Angular animations work by adding CSS classes to elements only
  during key events, (or triggering Javascript callbacks, we'll cover
  that in a bit), let's add a simple fade animation to our
  directive with the constraint that the Javascript can only add or
  remove CSS classes. The Javascript will not know what the animation
  does, and if the CSS classes are not defined, the directive will
  still work but with no animations.
  </p>
  <h3>
  This should provide some illumination into how
  $animate works.
  </h3>
  <p>
  The animation for myHide will fade the opacity of the element
  from 1 to 0, (and back when the state is toggled). At the end of the
  animation, display should be set to none.
  </p>
  <p>
  And this presents an interesting problem, because you can't set
  display to none until the end of the animation &mdash;
  otherwise the whole animation is running while the element isn't
  visible. Oops. So you will need one CSS class to represent the
  transition/animation and another CSS class to set display to none after
  everything is done.
  </p>
  
  <h3>The CSS so far would look like ... </h3>
  
  {% highlight css %}
//the final state
.hide {
    display: none;
}
//the animation
.hide-add-start {
    transition: opacity 1s;
    opacity: 0;
}
  {% endhighlight %}
  
  <p>
    And then a few lines of Javascript in the directive to add the classes at the
  right time
  </p>

  {% highlight javascript %}
// add this first to start the animation
elem.addClass("hide-add-start");
setTimeout(function() {
    // add the hide class after animation is finished
    elem.addClass("hide");
    // clean up
    elem.removeClass("hide-add-start");
}, 1000);
  {% endhighlight %}

  <p>
  So the .hide-add-start class adds the transition and the final value, and
  then after the transition is done the .hide class is added which
  sets display to none.
  </p>
  
  <h3>The CSS for removing and animating the hide class</h3>
  
    {% highlight css %}
.hide-remove {
    transition: opacity 1s;
    opacity: 0;
}
.hide-remove-active {
    opacity: 1;
}
  {% endhighlight %}

  <p>
  To animate when the .hide class is removed, the first step is to set
  the opacity to 0. What would happen if you removed the hide class
  without setting the opacity to 0? The element
  would just pop in with no animation at all. 
  </p>
  <p>
  In order to create a transition from an opacity of 0 to 1, you need
  another class to define the end state. So one class will define the
  start state plus transition/animation and another will define the
  end state to animate to.
  </p>
  <p>
The Javascript is almost exactly the same as adding the .hide class,
  but there are now two classes.
  </p>
{% highlight js %}
elem.addClass("hide-remove");
elem.removeClass("hide");
  // cause a reflow
elem[0].offsetHeight;
elem.addClass("hide-remove-active");
setTimeout(function(){
    elem.removeClass("hide-remove");
    elem.removeClass("hide-remove-active");
}, 1000);
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
The line between removing .hide and adding .hide-remove-active causes
  a reflow. Without it, the browser doesn't apply the transition and
  the element just pops in.
</p>
<h3>And the final result ...</h3>

<div class="myHideExample" ng-controller="example">
  <div class="message">
      <p my-hide-animated="awesome">Hide this text if awesome</p>
  </div>
  <button class="button" ng-click="awesome = !awesome">Toggle awesomeness</button>
</div>

  <h2>And now you know how $animate and ngAnimate module work</h2>

  <p>
  Adding animations to your directive is not as simple as adding and
  removing a class. You need to know when the animation starts, when
  it ends, what the start and end states are, and the Javascript needs
  to coordinate all of it. And that's exactly what $animate does.
  </p>
  <p>
  The $animate service has methods for adding/removing classes and
  elements. When you use these methods in your directive, Angular automatically adds and
  removes classes to the element you are animating.
  </p>
  <p>
  It adds and removes classes at correct times so you can define start and end
  states. Not only that, it reads the times from your CSS, so you
  define the timing in one place.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Rewrite the directive to use $animate</h2>

  <p>
  The $animate service has several methods for adding, removing,
  moving elements or adding or removing classes. The idea is to use
  those methods instead of directly manipulating the DOM and let
  Angular trigger Javascript animations or add/remove the extra
  CSS classes you need.
  </p>
  <p>
  You can inject the $animate service without loading ngAnimate and
  everything will still work, it just won't trigger your
  animations. This is great because you can now create custom
  directives that will work even if animations aren't defined or used.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you do want animations to be activated, you have to download
    the ng-animate module Javascript (however you want) and include the
    ng-animate module in your app, like so:
  </p>

  {% highlight javascript %}
var app = angular.module('animations', ['ngAnimate']);
  {% endhighlight %}

  <p>
  With $animate, the new version of the myHide directive now looks
  like this.
  </p>
  
  {% highlight javascript%}
app.directive("myHide", function($animate){
    return {
        restrict: 'A',
        link: function(scope, elem, attrs){
            scope.$watch(attrs.myHide, function(value){
                if (value) {
                    $animate.addClass(elem, "hide");
                } else {
                    $animate.removeClass(elem, "hide");
                }
            });
        }
    };
});
{% endhighlight %}

  <p>
  The CSS is going to be slightly different. In addition to the actual
  class you are adding to your element, addClass and
  removeClass add two additional classes: one for the animation and
  the starting styles and one more for the end styles. Both of these
  extra classes are removed at the end.
  </p>
  <p>
    The CSS classes added follow a naming convention. So the class you
    are adding in this case is "hide" so $animate will add a
    "hide-add" class where you should define the animation and the
    starting styles and then a "hide-add-active" class which will
    contain any end styles.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here is a screenshot of <a href="https://code.angularjs.org/1.3.10/docs/api/ngAnimate/service/$animate">the
    docs</a> which explains exactly what extra classes are created,
    the naming convention, and when each of the classes is added.
  </p>
  <figure>
    <img src="/images/angular/addclass.png" />
  </figure>

  <p>
    With that in mind, the CSS looks like:
  </p>

  {% highlight css %}
.hide-add {
    display: block;
    transition: opacity 1s;
    opacity: 1;
}
.hide-add-active {
    opacity: 0;
}
.hide-remove {
    transition: opacity 1s;
    display: block;
    opacity: 0;
}
.hide-remove-active {
    opacity: 1;
}  
  {% endhighlight %}

<p>
  The "hide-add" class sets display to "block" because the "hide"
  class is added at the same time and it sets the display to
  "none". Not what we want.
</p>

<h3>The end result using ngAnimate</h3>

<div class="myHideExample" ng-controller="example">
  <div class="message">
    <p my-hide-ng-animate="awesome">Hide this text if awesome</p>
  </div>
  <button class="button" ng-click="awesome = !awesome">Toggle awesomeness</button>
</div>

<p>
  Even though this directive is only adding a class, $animate also
  supports methods for other operations on the DOM which will also
  add/remove CSS classes for you so you can animate basically anything
  in your Angular app.
</p>

<p>
  Most of the built-in directives use $animate to do DOM manipulation, so that
  means you can animate those as well. The list of built-in directives
  that use $animate and what they support is <a href="https://code.angularjs.org/1.3.10/docs/api/ngAnimate">here</a>.
</p>

<h2>ngAnimate and Javascript animations</h2>

<p>
  You can use Javascript animations instead of CSS
  animations/transitions. The following examples use <a href="http://greensock.com/tweenmax">TweenMax</a>, 
  but you can use whatever library you want.
</p>

<p>
  In addition to adding CSS classes, the $animate service will also
  trigger any Javascript animations you define in your app.
</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
app.directive("myHideJs", function($animate){
    return {
        restrict: 'A',
        link: function(scope, elem, attrs){
            scope.$watch(attrs.myHideJs, function(value){
                if (value) {
                    $animate.addClass(elem, "hide-js");
                } else {
                    $animate.removeClass(elem, "hide-js");
                }
            });
        }
    };
});


app.animation('.hide-js-animated', function(){
    return {
        addClass: function(element, className){
            TweenMax.to(element, 1, {
                'opacity': 0
                });
        },
        removeClass: function(element, className){
            TweenMax.to(element, 1, {
                'opacity': 1
            });
        }
    }
});
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  You can see, in the directive you use the $animate service the same
  way you use it for CSS animations. There's no difference.
</p>

<p>
  Below the directive is the animation. The animation is named using a
  simple, single CSS class selector. Any element that uses this
  animation must have this class, otherwise it won't be animated.
</p>

<p>
  The object returned by the animation call defines two properties,
  addClass and removeClass. These are defined because the directive is
  using addClass and removeClass. If the directive was removing or
  adding elements instead, you would define the 'leave' or 'enter'
  properties.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://code.angularjs.org/1.3.10/docs/api/ngAnimate">The full list of events is here</a>, in the
  "JavaScript-defined Animations" section.
</p>

<p>Here is the Angular template using the Javascript animation. Note
the class on the element that will eventually be animated matches the
name of the animation defined by the Angular app.</p>

{% highlight html %}
<div class="myHideExample" ng-controller="example">
  <div class="message">
    <p my-hide-js="awesome" class="hide-js-animated">Hide this text if awesome</p>
  </div>
  <button class="button" ng-click="awesome = !awesome">Toggle awesomeness</button>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

<div class="myHideExample" ng-controller="example">
  <div class="message">
    <p my-hide-js="awesome" class="hide-js-animated">Hide this text if awesome</p>
  </div>
  <button class="button" ng-click="awesome = !awesome">Toggle awesomeness</button>
</div>


<h2>Animating built-in directives</h2>
  
<p>
  Most of the built-in directives use $animate just like the myHide
  directive. Just look at the code for ngHide:
</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
var ngHideDirective = ['$animate', function($animate) {
  return {
    restrict: 'A',
    multiElement: true,
    link: function(scope, element, attr) {
      scope.$watch(attr.ngHide, function ngHideWatchAction(value) {
        // The comment inside of the ngShowDirective explains why we add and
        // remove a temporary class for the show/hide animation
        $animate[value ? 'addClass' : 'removeClass'](element,NG_HIDE_CLASS, {
          tempClasses: NG_HIDE_IN_PROGRESS_CLASS
        });
      });
    }
  };
}];
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  Look familiar? That's because it's almost exactly the same as the
  myHide directive you've been looking at this whole time. There are a
  couple differences, mainly ngHide uses a ternary operator instead of
  an if/else to determine calling addClass or removeClass. 
</p>

<p>
  If you look at the other built-in directives, you'll see calls to
  $animate. The documentation for each directive records which events
  you can hook into an animate. Then it's just a matter of either
  creating CSS animations or Javascript animations and matching all of
  your names to the naming convention.
</p>
  
  <h2>Sick of all the 'magic' in Angular?</h2>
  <p>
    The Angular learning curve is a doozy. It's worth it in the end,
    but Angular is filled with a more than a few strange, new concepts
    and the end result can sometimes look downright magical.
  </p>
  <p>
    All frameworks are opinionated, Angular is no exception. The
    problem is with Angular you can start creating apps that work
    easily, but before you know it you're running into problems
    that are difficult to troubleshoot and debug.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you don't do things the "Angular way", you are swimming
    against the current. But how do you figure out the <em>right</em>
    way to do something in Angular?
