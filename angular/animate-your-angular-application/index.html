  <p>
    When an Angular app refreshes the DOM, the default experience
    is jarring
  because Angular dumps the elements into the view with no
    transition. 
  </p>
  <p>
  The good news is Angular comes with great support for
    animations. The bad news is, it might not be exactly what you
    expected. Angular doesn't do animations for you, instead it
    provides events you can hook into with your own, custom animations.
  </p>

  <h2>Understanding $animate and the ngAnimate module</h2>
  
  <p>
    In a non-Angular Javascript app, you write the code that updates
    the DOM, so while you're writing that code you sprinkle in some
    custom animations, NBD. But in an Angular app you're often using
    built-in directives and not mucking around in the DOM <em>directly</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
  So what's a developer to do?
  </p>
  <h3>
    How would animations work in a web application if you weren't using
  Angular?
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    You would:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Define your starting and end styles</li>
    <li>Add or change an element and set it to the starting style</li>
    <li>Animate to the end style</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  And you're either doing this with Javascript or CSS.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you add animations to your Angular application, you follow this
    pattern, but in a very Angular-y way that completely decouples your
animation code from your directive code.
  </p>

  <h3>This is a good thing.</h3>
  <p>
    Angular's built-in directives are pre-wired for animations. What
    that means is you get access to animation "events" which you can
    hook into with either CSS classes or Javascript code. These events
  correspond with adding or removing elements or classes &mdash;
  basically anything that might make sense to animate.
  </p>
  <p>
    That might sound a bit weird to you right now, but the upside is
  you can create your own custom directives and then let end users of
  those directives define their own animations.
  </p>
  <h3>Code reuse FTW.</h3>
  <p>
  This is exactly how Angular designed its own directives. This way
  developers and designers get to choose animations because they aren't
  predefined by Angular. And you can create the animations any way you
  like, with CSS transitions/animations or a Javascript libary.
  </p>
  <h2>Build your own directive</h2>
  <p>
    It's easier to understand how all the pieces fit together if you build
    and animate a simple custom directive you write yourself. Then you can circle back and
    understand <em>exactly</em> what's happening in the built-in directives.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here is a simple directive for hiding an element with no support for animations:
  </p>
  
  {% highlight javascript %}
app.controller("example1", function($scope){
    $scope.awesome = false;
});
  
app.directive("myHide", function(){
    return {
        restrict: 'A',
        link: function(scope, elem, attrs){
            scope.$watch(attrs.myHide, function(value){
                if (value) {
                    elem.addClass("hide");
                } else {
                    elem.removeClass("hide");
                }
            });
        }
    };
});
  {% endhighlight %}
  
  <p>
    The myHide directive watches an expression, (in this case the
    value of 'awesome'), and when the expression
    evaluates as truthy, adds a class to the element and removes it when
    it's false. The class sets display to none, so the myHide element is
    hidden when the expression is truthy.
  </p>
  
  {% highlight html %}
  <div class="myHideExample" ng-controller="example1">
    <div class="message">
      <p my-hide="awesome">Hide this text if awesome</p>
    </div>
    <button class="button" ng-click="awesome = !awesome">Toggle awesomeness</button>
  </div>  
  {% endhighlight %}
  
  <div class="myHideExample" ng-controller="example1">
    <div class="message">
      <p my-hide="awesome">Hide this text if awesome</p>
    </div>
    <button class="button" ng-click="awesome = !awesome">Toggle awesomeness</button>
  </div>

  <p>
    This works, but there is no transition, it just pops in and out of existence.
  </p>

  <h2>Add an animation to this directive without $animate</h2>
  <p>
  Since Angular animations work by adding CSS classes to elements only
  during key events, (or triggering Javascript callbacks, we'll cover
  that in a bit), let's add a simple fade animation to our
  directive with the constraint that the Javascript can only add or
  remove CSS classes. The Javscript will not know what the animation
  does, and if the CSS classes are not defined, the directive will
  still work but with no animations.
  </p>
  <h3>
  This should provide some illumination into how
  $animate works.
  </h3>
  <p>
  The animation for myHide will fade the opacity of the element
  from 1 to 0, (and back when the state is toggled). At the end of the
  animation, display should be set to none.
  </p>
  <p>
  And this presents an interesting problem, because you can't set
  display to none until the end of the animation &mdash;
  otherwise the whole animation is running while the element isn't
  visible. Oops. So you will need one CSS class to represent the
  transition/animation and another CSS class to set display to none after
  everything is done.
  </p>
  
  <h3>The CSS so far would look like ... </h3>
  
  {% highlight css %}
//the final state
.hide {
    display: none;
}
//the animation
.hide-add {
    transition: opacity 1s;
    //don't strictly need this ..
    opacity: 0;
}
  {% endhighlight %}
  
  <p>And then a few lines of Javascript in the directive to add the classes at the
  right time</p>
  {% highlight javascript %}
// add this first to start the animation
elem.addClass("hide-add");
setTimeout(function() {
    // add the hide class after animation is finished
    elem.addClass("hide");
    // clean up
    elem.removeClass("hide-add");
}, 1000);
  {% endhighlight %}
  <p>
  So the .hide-add class adds the transition and the final value, and
  then after the transition is done the .hide class is added which
  sets display to none.
  </p>
  
  <h3>The CSS for removing and animating the hide class</h3>
  
    {% highlight css %}
.hide-remove {
    transition: opacity 1s;
    opacity: 0;
}
.hide-remove-active {
    opacity: 1;
}
  {% endhighlight %}

  
  <p>
  To animate when the .hide class is removed, the first step is to set
  the opacity to 0. What would happen if you removed the hide class
  without setting the opacity to 0? The element
  would just pop in with no animation at all. 
  </p>
  <p>
  In order to create a transition from an opacity of 0 to 1, you need
  another class to define the end state. So one class will define the
  start state plus transition/animation and another will define the
  end state to animate to.
  </p>
  <p>
The Javascript is almost exactly the same as adding the .hide class,
  but there are now two classes.
  </p>
{% highlight js %}
elem.addClass("hide-remove");
elem.removeClass("hide");
  // cause a reflow
elem[0].offsetHeight;
elem.addClass("hide-remove-active");
setTimeout(function(){
    elem.removeClass("hide-remove");
    elem.removeClass("hide-remove-active");
}, 1000);
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
The line between removing .hide and adding .hide-remove-active causes
  a reflow. Without it, the browser doesn't apply the transition and
  the element just pops in.
</p>
<h3>And the final result ...</h3>
  <div class="myHideExample" ng-controller="example1">
    <div class="message">
      <p my-hide-animated="awesome">Hide this text if awesome</p>
    </div>
    <button class="button" ng-click="awesome = !awesome">Toggle awesomeness</button>
  </div>

  <h2>And now you know how $animate and ngAnimate module work</h2>

  <p>
  Adding animations to your directive is not as simple as adding and
  removing a class. You need to know when the animation starts, when
  it ends, what the start and end states are, and the Javascript needs
  to coordinate all of it. And that's exactly what $animate does.
  </p>
  <p>
  The $animate service has methods for adding/removing classes and
  elements. When you use these methods in your directive, Angular automatically adds and
  removes classes to the element you are animating.
  </p>
  <p>
  It adds classes at various times so you can define start and end
  states and several other issues that you'll run into when
  creating animations not covered here.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Rewrite the directive to use $animate</h2>

  <p>
  The $animate service has several methods for adding, removing,
  moving elements or adding or removing classes. The idea is to use
  those methods instead of directly manipulating the DOM, and then
  Angular will trigger Javscript animations or add/remove the extra
  CSS classes you need.
  </p>
  <p>
  You can inject the $animate service without loading ngAnimate and
  everything will still work, it just won't trigger your
  animations. This is great because you can now create custom
  directives that will work even if animations aren't defined or used.
  </p>
  <p>
  With $animate, the new version of the myHide directive now looks
  like this.
  </p>

  <p>
      - want to use javascript animation instead?
      -- here's how you trigger it with $animate
      -- here's how you define it
  </p>
  
  <p>
    - all built-in directives use $animate like this, so you can define your own animations
    - look at code for ngShow
    - so for ngShow, you just hook in using their CSS classes
  </p>
