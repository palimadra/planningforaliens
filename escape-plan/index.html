      <h1>    
        Nothing sucks the joy out of programming like a job. 
      </h1>
      
      <h2>
        Hey there fellow web developer. 
      </h2>
      <p>
        Or maybe you're the "front-end guy", "Rails ninja" or whatever arbitrary thing your company decided to call you.
      </p>
      <p>
        How's the ol' day job treating you?
      </p>
            
      <h2>
        Web development used to be an adventure every day.
      </h2>
      
        <p>
          Now you find yourself mucking around in the same, epic pile of spaghetti code for the same doomed projects using the same technologies you learned years ago.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Every day you nearly die of boredom attaching yet another form to the same old CRUD backend.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Every day you endure a long commute to wrestle with ancient bugs and do battle with managers that just don't get it.
      </p>
      
      <h2>
        It's more than just frustrating and boring. Your career is in jeopardy
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        Look around you, (yeah, I know you are reading this while at work in your cubicle), do you see the developer that's been with the company for years and years? You know the guy. He's an expert on some old system nobody else understands.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        How would he fare if he was laid off? Can you imagine the pressure he must feel every day? His financial security is tied directly to the success of the company.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        How long until you are that guy? Are you feeling the pressure? Because if you keep coasting at work without learning new skills, the pressure keeps building and building ...
      </p>
      
      
      <h2>
        Release the pressure valve and rekindle your passion for the web.
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        What you need is a blank text editor screen. An empty Git repository. A fresh, clean slate for new adventures with technology you never see at your job.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        What you need is a side project you can actually finish in the limited spare time you have.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Crunk.io is a structured sprint to create a project with a web technology you haven't used yet. An hour or so every night for one week or one long weekend day, however you work best. At the end of a sprint you'll have a working project and a fundamental grasp of the topic that can only come from hands on experience.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Even better, you'll be taking a step towards getting unstuck and reigniting your passion for technology that started you on this path in the first place.
      </p>

        Sprints run every month or so and I only announce them to this list.

        What topics are covered?
      </h2>

      <p>
        First up is Angular.js. Future topics 
      </p>

      <h2>Will it cost money?</h2>

      <p>
        Yup. 
      </p>

        How does it work?

      <h2>
        Who has the time and energy for side projects?
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        What project should you even work on? You've done side projects in the past but they languish, unfinished in code repositories, too patchy/rough to share with potential employers.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Whatever you do, don't hunker down and stick it out. A career in web development requires extra effort to stay up to date. Really good companies know this and budget for training and conferences. If you're not lucky enough to work for one of these companies, it's entirely up to you.

        How it works. (interactive videos, cheat sheets, tons of example code, forum for questions, etc)
