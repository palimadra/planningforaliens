        It's your first day at your new job. You're enthusiastic and eager to hone your skills as a developer on the new challenges in front of you.
      </p>

      <p>
          Fast forward through a few years of unrealistic deadlines, doomed projects and hundreds of meetings: your dreams are shattered. All you're left with is piles of deadly, ancient code and intermittent bugs that send you to the edge of insanity and back.
      </p>

        It's more than frustration and boredom. Your career is in jeopardy.

      <h2>
    Can you get a new job if you need it, or are your skills too rusty?
      </h2>

      <p>
        How are you supposed to stay up to date when managers squash your proposals for using new libraries, languages and frameworks?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em >How many of your work projects never even see the light of day?</em> 
      </p>
      <p>
        Internal politics and bad project management kill your resume and make you feel worthless.
      </p>
      
      <h2>"Just start a side project" doesn't work.<img class="octo" src="octocat.jpg" /></h2>
      <p>
        The standard advice is to work on a side project.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <em >Most side projects end up as Github Ghost Towns.</em> 
      </p>
      <p>
        Probably because you're drained at the end of the day and don't have the energy for your best work.
      </p>

      <h2>What if there was a better way?</h2>
      
      <p>
        What if your Github profile was <em>filled with interesting projects</em> created with languages or frameworks you want to use daily in your career? 
      </p>
      <p>
        Would you <em>feel better</em> about shopping your resume around? 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Would you <em>worry less</em> about losing your job?

The average technical book weighs 16 pounds and is about 800 pages long. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Okay, that's perhaps a slight exaggeration. But, still ...

        <em >Most training does not respect your time.</em>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Escape Plans are a sprint to create a project with a technology you've never used at a pace that assumes you know what you are doing.
      </p>


      <p>
        Each course fits into an hour or so every night for one week or one long weekend day, however you work best. At the end of a sprint you'll have a working project and a fundamental grasp of the topic that can only come from hands on experience.

      <h2>What topics will be covered?</h2>
      
      <p>
        Topics are still TBD, (although the first lesson is already well under way), but likely candidates are frameworks like Angular or Meteor, big libraries like D3.js, languages like Go or Haskell. For the most part the curriculum will be geared towards experienced developers, but there will also be courses to help bridge any gap in experience.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        If you have a cool thing you really wish you had time to learn, you can send suggestions to sean@planningforaliens.com.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Can I choose my own project?</h2>
      
      <p>
        Of course! Say for example you've signed up for the Angular.js escape plan and really, really want to build your own mortgage calculator, (or whatever). You can totally make this happen. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Lessons are structured to teach a concept and then followed up with exercises. The exercises assume you are following along with the built in project, but with a little thought you can apply the exercises to your own project instead.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The problem with this is most side projects fail, and they usually fail because they are too ambitious. Escape Plans are structured around projects that are very carefully scoped to make sure you finish. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Also, if your side project goes way outside the scope of the class, I can't provide as much help in the forums. 
      </p>
      
      <h2>What format are the lessons in?</h2>
      
      <p>
        Lessons are a combination of screencasts and "interactive videos", a format I created and use to teach Flexbox. You can see a crude example <a href="http://www.sketchingwithcss.com/flexbox/">here</a>, but I'm upgrading the format and if you sign up for the launch list, I'll send you an example of the final format.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Are the lessons live?</h2>
      
      <p>
        No. Lessons are designed to be self-paced and to fit into your schedule when you have time. So it's not really possible to do these live. 
      </p>
      
      <h2>What if I have questions?</h2>
      
      <p>
        Each Escape Plan will have a forum where you can go and ask questions and I'll drop by from time to time to help you out. You can also email me any time.
      </p>
      
      <h2>What are the requirements for each Escape Plan?</h2>
      
      <p>
        The requirements will vary for each Escape Plan. For example, if you are doing an Angular project, the curriculum will assume you know Javascript, HTML and CSS at a pretty high level.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        There will be a self-assessment for each Escape Plan so you can make sure you won't be in over your head.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Who is the teacher?</h2>
      
      <p>
        <img class="me" src="me.jpg" alt="Sean Fioritto"></img>
        Hey there, I'm Sean, and I'm probably a lot like you. I make stuff for the web. I have a CS degree, but the last 8 years of my career have been a more potent teacher.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recently, I wrote a book on web development called <a href="http://www.sketchingwithcss.com/">Sketching with CSS</a>. I'm also an <a href="http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2013/11/18/the-future-of-video-in-web-design/">author in Smashing Magazine</a> and I've written some <a href="https://github.com/sfioritto/charlie.js">cool open source projects</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, I'm an entrepreneur. In the not so distant past I did the usual 9-5 thing doing web development for a couple big companies.
      </p>
