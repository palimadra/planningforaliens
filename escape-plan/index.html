      <h2>Clueless managers. Mountains of spaghetti code. Intermittent bugs.</h2>
      <p>
        Your job probably started off as an exciting opportunity for you to grow your career. 
      </p>
      <p>
          After a few years of unrealistic deadlines and a thousand hours of meetings all you're left with is piles of deadly, ancient code and intermittent bugs that send you to the edge of insanity and back.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Web development has lost its luster.</h2>
      
      <p>
        Drive to work. Attach this form to that CRUD backend. Go to meetings. Fix that bug you thought you fixed last week. Scan Hacker News. Go to meetings. Drive home. Repeat.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <em>Remember how fun it was to learn something new all the time?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Now your work days teeter perilously over a bottomless pit boredom and frustration.
      </p>

      <h2>
        It's more than frustration and boredom. Your career is in jeopardy.
      </h2>

      <p>
      Can you get a new job if you need it, or are your skills too rusty?
      </p>

      <p>
        Do you see other projects and companies on Hacker News or Reddit and feel a little nervous about not knowing the stack they used?
      </p>

      <p>
        How are you supposed to refresh your skills and stay up to date when managers always squash your proposals for using new libraries, languages and frameworks?
      </p>

      <p>
        How many of your work projects never even see the light of day because of internal politics or bad project management? You have very little to point future employers to show off your skills.
      </p>
      
      <h2>If you let your skills get stale, you run out of options. </h2>
      
      <p>
        Look around you, (yeah, I know you are reading this while at work in your cubicle), do you see the developer that's been with the company for years and years? You know the guy. He's an expert on some old system nobody else understands.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        How would he fare if he was laid off? Can you imagine the pressure he must feel every day? 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Because if you keep coasting at work without learning new skills, you'll be that guy in a few years.
      </p>
      
      <h2>"Just start a side project" doesn't work.</h2>
      
      <p>
        The standard advice is to work on a side project.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The sad reality is most side projects end up as Github Ghost Towns. Probably because you're drained at the end of the day and don't have the energy for your best work.
      </p>
      
      <h2>You need an Escape Plan.</h2>
      
      <p>
        What if your Github profile was filled with interesting projects created with languages or frameworks you want to use daily in your career? 
      </p>
      <p>
        Would you feel a little better about shopping your resume around? 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Would you worry less about losing your job?
      </p>
      
      <h2>Escape Plans are designed for you.</h2>

      <p>
        Escape Plans are training for busy, experienced web developers. Each course is a sprint to create a project with a technology you haven't used yet.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most training assumes you have scads of free time. Just imagine the thud of the last 400 page technical book you bought as it hits your desk. That is not respecting your time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each Escape Plan course fits into hour or so every night for one week or one long weekend day, however you work best. At the end of a sprint you'll have a working project and a fundamental grasp of the topic that can only come from hands on experience.
      </p>

      <h2>Questions you probably have rattling around in your head.</h2>
      
      <h2>What topics will be covered?</h2>
      
      <p>
        Topics are still TBD, (although the first lesson is already well under way), but likely candidates are frameworks like Angular or Meteor, big libraries like D3.js, languages like Go or Haskell. For the most part the curriculum will be geared towards experienced developers, but there will also be courses to help beginners bridge the gap.

        If you have a cool thing you really wish you had time to learn, you can send suggestions to sean@planningforaliens.com.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Can I choose my own project?</h2>
      
      <p>
        Of course! Say for example you've signed up for the Angular.js escape plan and really, really want to build your own mortgage calculator. You can totally make this happen. Lessons are structured to teach a concept and then followed up with exercises. The exercises assume you are following along with the built in project, but with a little thought you can apply the exercises to your own project instead.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The problem with this is most side projects fail, and they usually fail because they are too ambitious. Escape Plans are structured around projects that are very carefully scoped to make sure you finish. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Also, if your side project goes way outside the scope of the class, I can't provide as much help in the forums. 
      </p>
      
      <h2>What format are the lessons in?</h2>
      
      <p>
        Lessons are a combination of screencasts and "interactive videos", a format I created and use to teach Flexbox. You can see a crude example 'here', but I'm upgrading the format and if you sign up for the launch list, I'll definitely send you an example.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Are the lessons live?</h2>
      
      <p>
        No. Lessons are designed to be self-paced and to fit into your schedule when you have time. So it's not really possible to do these live. 
      </p>
      
      <h2>What if I have questions?</h2>
      
      <p>
        Each Escape Plan will have a forum where you can go and ask questions and I'll drop by from time to time to help you out. You can also email me any time.
      </p>
      
      <h2>What are the requirements for each Escape Plan?</h2>
      
      <p>
        The requirements will vary for each Escape Plan. For example, if you are doing an Angular project, the curriculum will assume you know Javascript, HTML and CSS at a pretty high level.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        There will be a self-assessment for each Escape Plan so you can make sure you won't be in over your head.
