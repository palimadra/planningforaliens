      <h2>You've tried designing in the browser but it stifles your creativity.</h2>
      <p>
        Every web design guru says you should be designing in the browser. But whenever you try, your creativity runs away and hides in a corner.
      </p>
      <p class="emphatic">
        You just can't get into a creative flow when you are coding.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your designs look boxy, bland, sterile and too structured. It's like your brain flipped a switch into Spok Mode.

      <h2>You don't feel free to experiment when you are designing with code.</h2>
      <p>
        When you start your design workflow in code, each design feels like a commitment because it took so long to make you don't want to throw it out.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you are using Photoshop you can rapidly iterate through designs. Working this way frees you up to be more creative and try new things.

        Writing code takes longer than making comps in Photoshop

      <h2>You feel guilty because all of the awesome people in our industry design in the browser.</h2>
      <p>
        And they have good reasons. If you did design in the browser you could:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Avoid creating PSDs for every conceivable breakpoint when you do a responsive design. </li>
        <li>Use Typekit right up front and focus on beautiful typography.</li>
        <li>Make changes to colors and fonts easily and in one place.</li>
        <li>
          Get feedback from clients on real, interactive prototypes.
        </li> 
        <li>Incorporate animations and transitions into mockups instead of having clients "imagine" effects.</li>
        <li>Work closely with front-end developers and speed up the entire process.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>If you can learn Photoshop, you can design in the browser.</h2>
      <p>
        All of the problems you have when designing in the browser? <span class="emphatic">These are just problems with your tools, not with you.</span> 
      </p>
      <p>
        Originally CSS and HTML weren't created with designers in mind. But modern CSS and HTML make prototyping easy &#8212; if you know the right tricks.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="emphatic">I'm putting together all of the tools and methods you need to know</span> for designing in the browser into a book: Effortless Design in the Browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        With these tools and methods at your disposal you can rapidly create prototypes of almost any design you can imagine.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create unrestricted layouts without floats, clears and margins.</li>
        <li>Try wild new designs without worrying.</li>
        <li>Make sweeping changes to your CSS trivially.</li>
        <li>Quickly test ideas directly in the browser.</li>
        <li>And more...</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Who is this book for?</h2>
      <p>
        This book is for web designers, not front-end developers. I will assume you have a working knowledge of CSS and HTML. If you have no experience with CSS and HTML then this book is perhaps not for you.
