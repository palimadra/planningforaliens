        <p>
          And they have good reasons. If you did design in the browser you could:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use Typekit right up front and focus on beautiful typography.</li>
          <li>Make changes to colors and fonts easily and in one place.</li>
          <li>Get feedback from clients on real, interactive prototypes.</li> 
          <li>Avoid creating PSDs for every conceivable breakpoint when you do a responsive design.</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="triangle-down"></div>

      <h2 class="big">Good news.</h2>
      <h2 class="bottomspace">Designing in the browser can be as <span class="cool">effortless</span> as sketching.</h2>
      <h2>And I'm putting together every tool and method you need to know into a book.</h2>
      <h2 class="big">Sketching with CSS.</h2>

      <p>
        You're a designer, not a developer, and this book keeps that in mind. But designing in the browser means writing code &#8212; that's the problem! The trick is to avoid getting bogged down in technical details.
      </p>

      <div class="bottomspace">
        <p>
          With the tools and methods in this book you will be able to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Bend layouts to your will without floats, clears and margins.</li>
          <li>Try wild new designs without worrying.</li>
          <li>Make sweeping changes to your CSS trivially.</li>
          <li>Quickly test ideas directly in the browser.</li>
          <li>And more...</li>

        <h2>Who is this book for?</h2>
        <p>
          This book is for web designers, not front-end developers. I will assume you have a working knowledge of CSS and HTML. If you have no experience with CSS and HTML then this book is perhaps not for you.
