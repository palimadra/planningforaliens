        And they have good reasons. If you did design in the browser you could:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use Typekit right up front and focus on beautiful typography.</li>
        <li>Make changes to colors and fonts easily and in one place.</li>
        <li>Get feedback from clients on real, interactive prototypes.</li> 
        <li>Avoid creating PSDs for every conceivable breakpoint when you do a responsive design.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="h2"><h2>Designing in the browser can be as effortless as sketching.</h2></div>
      <p>
        CSS and HTML weren't created with designers in mind. But modern CSS and HTML can make prototyping easy &#8212; if you know the right tricks.

      <div class="h2"><h2>Who is this book for?</h2></div>
      <p>
        This book is for web designers, not front-end developers. I will assume you have a working knowledge of CSS and HTML. If you have no experience with CSS and HTML then this book is perhaps not for you.
