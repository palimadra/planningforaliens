      <h2>A weekly(ish) newsletter for web people in the trenches</h2>

<main class="newsletter">
  
  <p> The web is stuffed with HTML5 evangelists, elite Javascript hackers, CSS3 black belts, mustachioed Node.js hipsters and responsive design gurus. It seems like <span class="skim">every day there's something new and revolutionary you need to learn</span> to keep up with the all the cool kids.</p>
  
  <p>
  To some extent, it's fun to read up on the latest tech. <span class="skim">Who doesn't like oohing and aahing over a flashy, HTML5 demo in Chrome Canary?</span> But at the same time, these kinds of demos and articles are frustrating. </p>

<p><span class="skim">What's the point if you never get to put to practice the topics they cover? </span></p>
  
  <p><em>Your</em> code has to work in IE8.</p>
  
  <p><em>Your</em> projects start with piles of legacy code, not a fresh, clean HTML document.</p>

  <p><em>Your</em> boss doesn't give a hoot about semantic markup.</p>
  
  <p class="skim">
    The real job of web development is messy and complicated.
  </p>
  
  <p>This is why every week or so I write for my newsletter on topics relevant to regular ol' web developers, like you and me.  I promise, there will never be a pedantic, semi-religious screed on responsive design. <span class="skim">Because we're in the thick of it, making real things on the web, for real people.</span> We don't have time for nonsense.</p>
  
  <div class="cta">
