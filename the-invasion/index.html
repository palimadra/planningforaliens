<h1>The Invasion</h1>
<h2>A weekly(ish) newsletter for web people in the trenches</h2>
</header>

<main class="post content newsletter">

<p> The web is stuffed with HTML5 evangelists, elite Javascript hackers, CSS3 black belts, mustachioed Node.js hipsters and responsive design gurus. It seems like every day there's something new and enticing to learn about. </p>

<p>The pace of change is overwhelming.</p>

<p>
But who doesn't like oohing and aahing over a flashy, HTML5 demo in Chrome Canari? It's fun reading about state of the art web development. At the same time, these kinds of demos and articles are frustrating. What's the point if you never get to put to practice the topics they cover? </p>

<p><em>Your</em> code has to work in IE8.</p>

<p><em>Your</em> projects start with piles of legacy code, not a fresh, clean HTML document.</p>

<p>
The real web is messy and complicated.
</p>

<p>This is why every week or so I write for my newsletter about topics relevant to real web developers, like you and me. We don't own agencies or have big, fancy clients. We're in the thick of it, making things for the web.</p>

<h2>Join over 3,000 web designers and web developers.</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Straightforward, practical tips and tricks for web development.</li>
  <li>Advice and thoughts for people in the trenches.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Who am I?</h3>

<p>
My name is Sean and I'm probably a lot like you. I make stuff for the web. My web dev skills are mostly self-taught over the last decade or so. I really love what I do.
</p>

<p>
Today, I'm an entrepreneur. For the last five years I worked for an unecessarily secretive and mysterious industrial supply company. Before that I worked for a few years (and way too many hours) for a <a href="http://www.accenture.com">consulting company</a>. I also have one of those fancy degree things in <a href="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/">computer science</a>.
