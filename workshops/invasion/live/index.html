    <h3>Host: Sean Fioritto</h3>
    <p>
      Sean's been building stuff for the web for over a decade. A few
      years ago he realized that prototyping was a separate skill that
      designers could learn and then ship code without becoming a
      full-fledged frontend developer. He's been teaching people the
      art of prototyping ever since.
