    "Designing in the browser" is really hard. Seriously.
  </h2>
  <p>
    It's one thing to know how to build a website, it's another thing
    entirely to sit down and design a website while writing code. 
    </p>
    <p>
      It's impossible to keep your mind thinking about the design when
      every few minutes you're diving into the docs for whatever grid
      system you decided to use. You can't be creative AND worry about
      performance AND write maintainable code AND worry about
      cross-browser compatibility â€” it's not possible and it's not
      even a good idea.
  </p>
  <h2>There's no such thing as a Unicorn.</h2>
  <p>
    You can't be both an expert designer and an expert developer, both fields are too
    vast. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The good news is, you don't have to be a Jedi master at
    front-end dev to be amazingly fast at creating prototypes. It
    requires learning only a very small subset of that much, much
    bigger front-end developer pie.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the workshop you will take home a list of actionable things you
    can do to improve your prototyping skills. You will leave with the
    mindset you must have when thinking about "designing in the
    browser".

      <h3>Host: Sean Fioritto</h3>
      <p>
        Sean's been building stuff for the web for over a decade. A few
        years ago he realized that prototyping was a separate skill that
        designers could learn and then ship code without becoming a
        full-fledged frontend developer. He's been teaching people the
        art of prototyping ever since.
